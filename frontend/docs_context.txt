```js
const QuickLRU = require('quick-lru');

const lru = new QuickLRU({maxSize: 1000});

lru.set('🦄', '🌈');

lru.has('🦄');
//=> true

lru.get('🦄');
//=> '🌈'
```

## API

### new QuickLRU(options?)

Returns a new instance.

### options

Type: `object`

#### maxSize

*Required*\
Type: `number`

The maximum number of items before evicting the least recently used items.

#### maxAge

Type: `number`\
Default: `Infinity`

The maximum number of milliseconds an item should remain in cache.
By default maxAge will be Infinity, which means that items will never expire.

Lazy expiration happens upon the next `write` or `read` call.

Individual expiration of an item can be specified by the `set(key, value, options)` method.

#### onEviction

*Optional*\
Type: `(key, value) => void`

Called right before an item is evicted from the cache.

Useful for side effects or for items like object URLs that need explicit cleanup (`revokeObjectURL`).

### Instance

The instance is [`iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols) so you can use it directly in a [`for…of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) loop.

Both `key` and `value` can be of any type.

#### .set(key, value, options?)

Set an item. Returns the instance.

Individual expiration of an item can be specified with the `maxAge` option. If not specified, the global `maxAge` value will be used in case it is specified on the constructor, otherwise the item will never expire.

#### .get(key)

Get an item.

#### .has(key)

Check if an item exists.

#### .peek(key)

Get an item without marking it as recently used.

#### .delete(key)

Delete an item.

Returns `true` if the item is removed or `false` if the item doesn't exist.

#### .clear()

Delete all items.

#### .resize(maxSize)

Update the `maxSize`, discarding items as necessary. Insertion order is mostly preserved, though this is not a strong guarantee.

Useful for on-the-fly tuning of cache sizes in live systems.

#### .keys()

Iterable for all the keys.

#### .values()

Iterable for all the values.

#### .entriesAscending()

Iterable for all entries, starting with the oldest (ascending in recency).

#### .entriesDescending()

Iterable for all entries, starting with the newest (descending in recency).

#### .size

The stored item count.

# Contributing to Hammer.js

Looking to contribute something to Hammer.js? **Here's how you can help.**


## Reporting issues

We only accept issues that are bug reports or feature requests. Bugs must be
isolated and reproducible problems that can be fixed within the Hammer.js.
Please read the following guidelines before opening any issue.

1. [**Read the documentation**](https://hammerjs.github.io)

2. **Search for existing issues.** We get a lot of duplicate issues, and you'd
help us out a lot by first checking if someone else has reported the same issue.
Moreover, the issue may have already been resolved with a fix available. Also
take a look if your problem is explained at the Wiki.

3. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case.** Be sure the problem exists
in Hammer's code with a reduced test case that should be included in each bug
report.

4. **Include a live example.** Make use of jsFiddle or jsBin to share your
isolated test cases. Also, a screen capture would work, with tools like LICEcap.

5. **Share as much information as possible.** Include operating system and
version, browser and version, version of Hammer.js, customized or vanilla build,
etc. where appropriate. Also include steps to reproduce the bug.

## Pull requests

1. Changes must be done in `/src` files, never just the compiled files. Also, don't 
commit the compiled files.

2. Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes. Keep them simple
and small

3. Try to share which browsers your code has been tested in before submitting a
pull request

4. Write tests for your code, these can be found in `/tests`.

# ansi-styles [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chalk/ansi-styles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chalk/ansi-styles)

> [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors_and_Styles) for styling strings in the terminal

You probably want the higher-level [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) module for styling your strings.

<img src="screenshot.svg" width="900">

## Install

```
$ npm install ansi-styles
```

## Usage

```js
const style = require('ansi-styles');

console.log(`${style.green.open}Hello world!${style.green.close}`);


// Color conversion between 16/256/truecolor
// NOTE: If conversion goes to 16 colors or 256 colors, the original color
//       may be degraded to fit that color palette. This means terminals
//       that do not support 16 million colors will best-match the
//       original color.
console.log(style.bgColor.ansi.hsl(120, 80, 72) + 'Hello world!' + style.bgColor.close);
console.log(style.color.ansi256.rgb(199, 20, 250) + 'Hello world!' + style.color.close);
console.log(style.color.ansi16m.hex('#abcdef') + 'Hello world!' + style.color.close);
```

## API

Each style has an `open` and `close` property.

## Styles

### Modifiers

- `reset`
- `bold`
- `dim`
- `italic` *(Not widely supported)*
- `underline`
- `inverse`
- `hidden`
- `strikethrough` *(Not widely supported)*

### Colors

- `black`
- `red`
- `green`
- `yellow`
- `blue`
- `magenta`
- `cyan`
- `white`
- `blackBright` (alias: `gray`, `grey`)
- `redBright`
- `greenBright`
- `yellowBright`
- `blueBright`
- `magentaBright`
- `cyanBright`
- `whiteBright`

### Background colors

- `bgBlack`
- `bgRed`
- `bgGreen`
- `bgYellow`
- `bgBlue`
- `bgMagenta`
- `bgCyan`
- `bgWhite`
- `bgBlackBright` (alias: `bgGray`, `bgGrey`)
- `bgRedBright`
- `bgGreenBright`
- `bgYellowBright`
- `bgBlueBright`
- `bgMagentaBright`
- `bgCyanBright`
- `bgWhiteBright`

## Advanced usage

By default, you get a map of styles, but the styles are also available as groups. They are non-enumerable so they don't show up unless you access them explicitly. This makes it easier to expose only a subset in a higher-level module.

- `style.modifier`
- `style.color`
- `style.bgColor`

###### Example

```js
console.log(style.color.green.open);
```

Raw escape codes (i.e. without the CSI escape prefix `\u001B[` and render mode postfix `m`) are available under `style.codes`, which returns a `Map` with the open codes as keys and close codes as values.

###### Example

```js
console.log(style.codes.get(36));
//=> 39
```

## [256 / 16 million (TrueColor) support](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728)

`ansi-styles` uses the [`color-convert`](https://github.com/Qix-/color-convert) package to allow for converting between various colors and ANSI escapes, with support for 256 and 16 million colors.

The following color spaces from `color-convert` are supported:

- `rgb`
- `hex`
- `keyword`
- `hsl`
- `hsv`
- `hwb`
- `ansi`
- `ansi256`

To use these, call the associated conversion function with the intended output, for example:

```js
style.color.ansi.rgb(100, 200, 15); // RGB to 16 color ansi foreground code
style.bgColor.ansi.rgb(100, 200, 15); // RGB to 16 color ansi background code

style.color.ansi256.hsl(120, 100, 60); // HSL to 256 color ansi foreground code
style.bgColor.ansi256.hsl(120, 100, 60); // HSL to 256 color ansi foreground code

style.color.ansi16m.hex('#C0FFEE'); // Hex (RGB) to 16 million color foreground code
style.bgColor.ansi16m.hex('#C0FFEE'); // Hex (RGB) to 16 million color background code
```

# callsites [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/callsites.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/callsites)

> Get callsites from the [V8 stack trace API](https://v8.dev/docs/stack-trace-api)


## Install

```
$ npm install callsites
```


## Usage

```js
const callsites = require('callsites');

function unicorn() {
	console.log(callsites()[0].getFileName());
	//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/dev/callsites/test.js'
}

unicorn();
```


## API

Returns an array of callsite objects with the following methods:

- `getThis`: returns the value of `this`.
- `getTypeName`: returns the type of `this` as a string. This is the name of the function stored in the constructor field of `this`, if available, otherwise the object's `[[Class]]` internal property.
- `getFunction`: returns the current function.
- `getFunctionName`: returns the name of the current function, typically its `name` property. If a name property is not available an attempt will be made to try to infer a name from the function's context.
- `getMethodName`: returns the name of the property of `this` or one of its prototypes that holds the current function.
- `getFileName`: if this function was defined in a script returns the name of the script.
- `getLineNumber`: if this function was defined in a script returns the current line number.
- `getColumnNumber`: if this function was defined in a script returns the current column number
- `getEvalOrigin`: if this function was created using a call to `eval` returns a string representing the location where `eval` was called.
- `isToplevel`: is this a top-level invocation, that is, is this the global object?
- `isEval`: does this call take place in code defined by a call to `eval`?
- `isNative`: is this call in native V8 code?
- `isConstructor`: is this a constructor call?

## Highlights

- Expressive API
- Highly performant
- Ability to nest styles
- [256/Truecolor color support](#256-and-truecolor-color-support)
- Auto-detects color support
- Doesn't extend `String.prototype`
- Clean and focused
- Actively maintained
- [Used by ~50,000 packages](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/chalk) as of January 1, 2020

## Install

```console
$ npm install chalk
```

## Usage

```js
const chalk = require('chalk');

console.log(chalk.blue('Hello world!'));
```

Chalk comes with an easy to use composable API where you just chain and nest the styles you want.

```js
const chalk = require('chalk');
const log = console.log;

// Combine styled and normal strings
log(chalk.blue('Hello') + ' World' + chalk.red('!'));

// Compose multiple styles using the chainable API
log(chalk.blue.bgRed.bold('Hello world!'));

// Pass in multiple arguments
log(chalk.blue('Hello', 'World!', 'Foo', 'bar', 'biz', 'baz'));

// Nest styles
log(chalk.red('Hello', chalk.underline.bgBlue('world') + '!'));

// Nest styles of the same type even (color, underline, background)
log(chalk.green(
	'I am a green line ' +
	chalk.blue.underline.bold('with a blue substring') +
	' that becomes green again!'
));

// ES2015 template literal
log(`
CPU: ${chalk.red('90%')}
RAM: ${chalk.green('40%')}
DISK: ${chalk.yellow('70%')}
`);

// ES2015 tagged template literal
log(chalk`
CPU: {red ${cpu.totalPercent}%}
RAM: {green ${ram.used / ram.total * 100}%}
DISK: {rgb(255,131,0) ${disk.used / disk.total * 100}%}
`);

// Use RGB colors in terminal emulators that support it.
log(chalk.keyword('orange')('Yay for orange colored text!'));
log(chalk.rgb(123, 45, 67).underline('Underlined reddish color'));
log(chalk.hex('#DEADED').bold('Bold gray!'));
```

Easily define your own themes:

```js
const chalk = require('chalk');

const error = chalk.bold.red;
const warning = chalk.keyword('orange');

console.log(error('Error!'));
console.log(warning('Warning!'));
```

Take advantage of console.log [string substitution](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/console.html#console_console_log_data_args):

```js
const name = 'Sindre';
console.log(chalk.green('Hello %s'), name);
//=> 'Hello Sindre'
```

## API

### chalk.`<style>[.<style>...](string, [string...])`

Example: `chalk.red.bold.underline('Hello', 'world');`

Chain [styles](#styles) and call the last one as a method with a string argument. Order doesn't matter, and later styles take precedent in case of a conflict. This simply means that `chalk.red.yellow.green` is equivalent to `chalk.green`.

Multiple arguments will be separated by space.

### chalk.level

Specifies the level of color support.

Color support is automatically detected, but you can override it by setting the `level` property. You should however only do this in your own code as it applies globally to all Chalk consumers.

If you need to change this in a reusable module, create a new instance:

```js
const ctx = new chalk.Instance({level: 0});
```

| Level | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| `0` | All colors disabled |
| `1` | Basic color support (16 colors) |
| `2` | 256 color support |
| `3` | Truecolor support (16 million colors) |

### chalk.supportsColor

Detect whether the terminal [supports color](https://github.com/chalk/supports-color). Used internally and handled for you, but exposed for convenience.

Can be overridden by the user with the flags `--color` and `--no-color`. For situations where using `--color` is not possible, use the environment variable `FORCE_COLOR=1` (level 1), `FORCE_COLOR=2` (level 2), or `FORCE_COLOR=3` (level 3) to forcefully enable color, or `FORCE_COLOR=0` to forcefully disable. The use of `FORCE_COLOR` overrides all other color support checks.

Explicit 256/Truecolor mode can be enabled using the `--color=256` and `--color=16m` flags, respectively.

### chalk.stderr and chalk.stderr.supportsColor

`chalk.stderr` contains a separate instance configured with color support detected for `stderr` stream instead of `stdout`. Override rules from `chalk.supportsColor` apply to this too. `chalk.stderr.supportsColor` is exposed for convenience.

## Styles

### Modifiers

- `reset` - Resets the current color chain.
- `bold` - Make text bold.
- `dim` - Emitting only a small amount of light.
- `italic` - Make text italic. *(Not widely supported)*
- `underline` - Make text underline. *(Not widely supported)*
- `inverse`- Inverse background and foreground colors.
- `hidden` - Prints the text, but makes it invisible.
- `strikethrough` - Puts a horizontal line through the center of the text. *(Not widely supported)*
- `visible`- Prints the text only when Chalk has a color level > 0. Can be useful for things that are purely cosmetic.

const chalk = require('chalk');

const miles = 18;
const calculateFeet = miles => miles * 5280;

console.log(chalk`
	There are {bold 5280 feet} in a mile.
	In {bold ${miles} miles}, there are {green.bold ${calculateFeet(miles)} feet}.
`);
```

Blocks are delimited by an opening curly brace (`{`), a style, some content, and a closing curly brace (`}`).

Template styles are chained exactly like normal Chalk styles. The following three statements are equivalent:

```js
console.log(chalk.bold.rgb(10, 100, 200)('Hello!'));
console.log(chalk.bold.rgb(10, 100, 200)`Hello!`);
console.log(chalk`{bold.rgb(10,100,200) Hello!}`);
```

Note that function styles (`rgb()`, `hsl()`, `keyword()`, etc.) may not contain spaces between parameters.

All interpolated values (`` chalk`${foo}` ``) are converted to strings via the `.toString()` method. All curly braces (`{` and `}`) in interpolated value strings are escaped.

## 256 and Truecolor color support

Chalk supports 256 colors and [Truecolor](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728) (16 million colors) on supported terminal apps.

Colors are downsampled from 16 million RGB values to an ANSI color format that is supported by the terminal emulator (or by specifying `{level: n}` as a Chalk option). For example, Chalk configured to run at level 1 (basic color support) will downsample an RGB value of #FF0000 (red) to 31 (ANSI escape for red).

Examples:

- `chalk.hex('#DEADED').underline('Hello, world!')`
- `chalk.keyword('orange')('Some orange text')`
- `chalk.rgb(15, 100, 204).inverse('Hello!')`

Background versions of these models are prefixed with `bg` and the first level of the module capitalized (e.g. `keyword` for foreground colors and `bgKeyword` for background colors).

- `chalk.bgHex('#DEADED').underline('Hello, world!')`
- `chalk.bgKeyword('orange')('Some orange text')`
- `chalk.bgRgb(15, 100, 204).inverse('Hello!')`

The following color models can be used:

- [`rgb`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) - Example: `chalk.rgb(255, 136, 0).bold('Orange!')`
- [`hex`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet) - Example: `chalk.hex('#FF8800').bold('Orange!')`
- [`keyword`](https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords) (CSS keywords) - Example: `chalk.keyword('orange').bold('Orange!')`
- [`hsl`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) - Example: `chalk.hsl(32, 100, 50).bold('Orange!')`
- [`hsv`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) - Example: `chalk.hsv(32, 100, 100).bold('Orange!')`
- [`hwb`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HWB_color_model) - Example: `chalk.hwb(32, 0, 50).bold('Orange!')`
- [`ansi`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3/4_bit) - Example: `chalk.ansi(31).bgAnsi(93)('red on yellowBright')`
- [`ansi256`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit) - Example: `chalk.bgAnsi256(194)('Honeydew, more or less')`

## Windows

If you're on Windows, do yourself a favor and use [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) instead of `cmd.exe`.

## Origin story

[colors.js](https://github.com/Marak/colors.js) used to be the most popular string styling module, but it has serious deficiencies like extending `String.prototype` which causes all kinds of [problems](https://github.com/yeoman/yo/issues/68) and the package is unmaintained. Although there are other packages, they either do too much or not enough. Chalk is a clean and focused alternative.

## chalk for enterprise

Available as part of the Tidelift Subscription.

The maintainers of chalk and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications. Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact dependencies you use.

### Fichier : `./node_modules/component-emitter/readme.md`
```markdown
# component-emitter

> Simple event emitter

## Install

```sh
npm install component-emitter
```

## Usage

As an `Emitter` instance:

```js
import Emitter from 'component-emitter';

const emitter = new Emitter();

emitter.emit('🦄');
```

As a mixin:

```js
import Emitter from 'component-emitter';

const user = {name: 'tobi'};
Emitter(user);

user.emit('I am a user');
```

As a prototype mixin:

```js
import Emitter from 'component-emitter';

Emitter(User.prototype);
```

## API

### new Emitter()

Create a new emitter.

### Emitter(object)

Use it as a mixin. For example a plain object may become an emitter, or you may extend an existing prototype.

### Emitter#on(event, listener)

Register an event handler that listens to a specified event.

### Emitter#once(event, listener)

Register a one-time event handler for a specified event.

### Emitter#off(event, listener)

Remove a specific event handler for a specified event.

### Emitter#off(event)

Remove all event handlers for a specified event.

### Emitter#off()

Remove all event handlers for all events.

### Emitter#emit(event, ...arguments)

Emit an event, invoking all handlers registered for it.

### Emitter#listeners(event)

Retrieve the event handlers registered for a specific event.

### Emitter#listenerCount(event)

Get the count of listeners for a specific event.

### Emitter#listenerCount()

Get the count of all event handlers in total.

### Emitter#hasListeners(event)

Check if there are any handlers registered for a specific event.

### Emitter#hasListeners()

Check if there are any handlers registered for any event.

## FAQ

### How does it differ from the Node.js EventEmitter?

It's simpler and more lightweight, and it works in any JavaScript environment, not just Node.js. It also provides mixin functionality to add event handling to existing objects without needing inheritance.

Re-releasing v[2.4.0] after discovering that the memory leak is isolated to the [`memo-parser`],
which is more or less experimental anyway.

- support scoped modules containing non word characters

## [2.2.0] - 2016-11-07

### Fixed
- Corrected a few gaffs in the auto-ignore logic to fix major performance issues
  with projects that did not explicitly ignore `node_modules`. ([#654])
- [`import/ignore` setting] was only being respected if the ignored module didn't start with
  an `import` or `export` JS statement
- [`prefer-default-export`]: fixed crash on export extensions ([#653])

## [2.0.1] - 2016-10-06

### Fixed
- Fixed code that relied on removed dependencies. ([#604])

## [2.0.0]! - 2016-09-30

### Added
- [`unambiguous`] rule: report modules that are not unambiguously ES modules.
- `recommended` shared config. Roughly `errors` and `warnings` mixed together,
  with some `parserOptions` in the mix. ([#402])
- `react` shared config: added `jsx: true` to `parserOptions.ecmaFeatures`.
- Added [`no-webpack-loader-syntax`] rule: forbid custom Webpack loader syntax in imports. ([#586], thanks [@fson]!)
- Add option `newlines-between: "ignore"` to [`order`] ([#519])
- Added [`no-unassigned-import`] rule ([#529])

### Breaking
- [`import/extensions` setting] defaults to `['.js']`. ([#306])
- [`import/ignore` setting] defaults to nothing, and ambiguous modules are ignored natively. This means importing from CommonJS modules will no longer be reported by [`default`], [`named`], or [`namespace`], regardless of `import/ignore`. ([#270])
- [`newline-after-import`]: Removed need for an empty line after an inline `require` call ([#570])
- [`order`]: Default value for `newlines-between` option is now `ignore` ([#519])

### Changed
- `imports-first` is renamed to [`first`]. `imports-first` alias will continue to
  exist, but may be removed in a future major release.
- Case-sensitivity: now specifically (and optionally) reported by [`no-unresolved`].
  Other rules will ignore case-mismatches on paths on case-insensitive filesystems. ([#311])

### Fixed
- [`no-internal-modules`]: support `@`-scoped packages ([#577]+[#578], thanks [@spalger])

## [1.16.0] - 2016-09-22

### Added
- Added [`no-dynamic-require`] rule: forbid `require()` calls with expressions. ([#567], [#568])
- Added [`no-internal-modules`] rule: restrict deep package imports to specific folders. ([#485], thanks [@spalger]!)
- [`extensions`]: allow override of a chosen default with options object ([#555], thanks [@ljharb]!)

### Fixed
- [`no-named-as-default`] no longer false-positives on `export default from '...'` ([#566], thanks [@preco21])
- [`default`]: allow re-export of values from ignored files as default ([#545], thanks [@skyrpex])

## [1.15.0] - 2016-09-12

### Added
- Added an `allow` option to [`no-nodejs-modules`] to allow exceptions ([#452], [#509]).
- Added [`no-absolute-path`] rule ([#530], [#538])
- [`max-dependencies`] for specifying the maximum number of dependencies (both `import` and `require`) a module can have. (see [#489], thanks [@tizmagik])
- Added glob option to config for [`no-extraneous-dependencies`], after much bikeshedding. Thanks, [@knpwrs]! ([#527])

### Fixed
- [`no-named-as-default-member`] Allow default import to have a property named "default" ([#507], [#508], thanks [@jquense] for both!)

## [1.14.0] - 2016-08-22

### Added
- [`import/parsers` setting]: parse some dependencies (i.e. TypeScript!) with a different parser than the ESLint-configured parser. ([#503])

### Fixed
- [`namespace`] exception for get property from `namespace` import, which are re-export from commonjs module ([#499] fixes [#416], thanks [@wKich])

## [1.13.0] - 2016-08-11

### Added
- `allowComputed` option for [`namespace`] rule. If set to `true`, won't report
  computed member references to namespaces. (see [#456])

### Changed
- Modified [`no-nodejs-modules`] error message to include the module's name ([#453], [#461])

### Fixed
- [`import/extensions` setting] is respected in spite of the appearance of imports
  in an imported file. (fixes [#478], thanks [@rhys-vdw])

## [1.12.0] - 2016-07-26

### Added
- [`import/external-module-folders` setting]: a possibility to configure folders for "external" modules ([#444], thanks [@zloirock])

## [1.11.1] - 2016-07-20

### Fixed
- [`newline-after-import`] exception for `switch` branches with `require`s iff parsed as `sourceType:'module'`.
  (still [#441], thanks again [@ljharb])

## [1.11.0] - 2016-07-17

### Added
- Added an `peerDependencies` option to [`no-extraneous-dependencies`] to allow/forbid peer dependencies ([#423], [#428], thanks [@jfmengels]!).

### Fixed
- [`newline-after-import`] exception for multiple `require`s in an arrow
  function expression (e.g. `() => require('a') || require('b')`). ([#441], thanks [@ljharb])

## [1.10.3] - 2016-07-08

### Fixed
- removing `Symbol` dependencies (i.e. `for-of` loops) due to Node 0.10 polyfill
  issue (see [#415]). Should not make any discernible semantic difference.

## [1.10.2] - 2016-07-04

### Fixed
- Something horrible happened during `npm prepublish` of 1.10.1.
  Several `rm -rf node_modules && npm i` and `gulp clean && npm prepublish`s later, it is rebuilt and republished as 1.10.2. Thanks [@rhettlivingston] for noticing and reporting!

## [1.10.1] - 2016-07-02 [YANKED]

### Added
- Officially support ESLint 3.x. (peerDependencies updated to `2.x - 3.x`)

## [1.10.0] - 2016-06-30

### Added
- Added new rule [`no-restricted-paths`]. ([#155]/[#371], thanks [@lo1tuma])
- [`import/core-modules` setting]: allow configuration of additional module names,
  to be treated as builtin modules (a la `path`, etc. in Node). ([#275] + [#365], thanks [@sindresorhus] for driving)
- React Native shared config (based on comment from [#283])

### Fixed
- Fixed crash with `newline-after-import` related to the use of switch cases. (fixes [#386], thanks [@ljharb] for reporting) ([#395])

## [1.9.2] - 2016-06-21

### Fixed
- Issues with ignored/CJS files in [`export`] and [`no-deprecated`] rules. ([#348], [#370])

## [1.9.1] - 2016-06-16

### Fixed
- Reordered precedence for loading resolvers. ([#373])

## [1.9.0] - 2016-06-10

### Added
- Added support TomDoc comments to [`no-deprecated`]. ([#321], thanks [@josh])
- Added support for loading custom resolvers ([#314], thanks [@le0nik])

### Fixed
- [`prefer-default-export`] handles `export function` and `export const` in same file ([#359], thanks [@scottnonnenberg])

## [1.8.1] - 2016-05-23

### Fixed
- `export * from 'foo'` now properly ignores a `default` export from `foo`, if any. ([#328]/[#332], thanks [@jkimbo])
  This impacts all static analysis of imported names. ([`default`], [`named`], [`namespace`], [`export`])
- Make [`order`]'s `newline-between` option handle multiline import statements ([#313], thanks [@singles])
- Make [`order`]'s `newline-between` option handle not assigned import statements ([#313], thanks [@singles])
- Make [`order`]'s `newline-between` option ignore `require` statements inside object literals ([#313], thanks [@singles])
- [`prefer-default-export`] properly handles deep destructuring, `export * from ...`, and files with no exports. ([#342]+[#343], thanks [@scottnonnenberg])

## [1.8.0] - 2016-05-11

### Added
- [`prefer-default-export`], new rule. ([#308], thanks [@gavriguy])

### Fixed
- Ignore namespace / ES7 re-exports in [`no-mutable-exports`]. ([#317], fixed by [#322]. thanks [@borisyankov] + [@jfmengels])
- Make [`no-extraneous-dependencies`] handle scoped packages ([#316], thanks [@jfmengels])

## [1.7.0] - 2016-05-06

### Added
- [`newline-after-import`], new rule. ([#245], thanks [@singles])
- Added an `optionalDependencies` option to [`no-extraneous-dependencies`] to allow/forbid optional dependencies ([#266], thanks [@jfmengels]).
- Added `newlines-between` option to [`order`] rule ([#298], thanks [@singles])
- add [`no-mutable-exports`] rule ([#290], thanks [@josh])
- [`import/extensions` setting]: a list of file extensions to parse as modules
  and search for `export`s. If unspecified, all extensions are considered valid (for now).
  In v2, this will likely default to `['.js', MODULE_EXT]`. ([#297], to fix [#267])

### Fixed
- [`extensions`]: fallback to source path for extension enforcement if imported
  module is not resolved. Also, never report for builtins (i.e. `path`). ([#296])

## [1.6.1] - 2016-04-28

### Fixed
- [`no-named-as-default-member`]: don't crash on rest props. ([#281], thanks [@SimenB])
- support for Node 6: don't pass `null` to `path` functions.
  Thanks to [@strawbrary] for bringing this up ([#272]) and adding OSX support to the Travis
  config ([#288]).

## [1.6.0] - 2016-04-25

### Added
- add [`no-named-as-default-member`] to `warnings` canned config
- add [`no-extraneous-dependencies`] rule ([#241], thanks [@jfmengels])
- add [`extensions`] rule ([#250], thanks [@lo1tuma])
- add [`no-nodejs-modules`] rule ([#261], thanks [@jfmengels])
- add [`order`] rule ([#247], thanks [@jfmengels])
- consider `resolve.fallback` config option in the webpack resolver ([#254])

### Changed
- [`imports-first`] now allows directives (i.e. `'use strict'`) strictly before
  any imports ([#256], thanks [@lemonmade])

### Fixed
- [`named`] now properly ignores the source module if a name is re-exported from
  an ignored file (i.e. `node_modules`). Also improved the reported error. (thanks to [@jimbolla] for reporting)
- [`no-named-as-default-member`] had a crash on destructuring in loops (thanks for heads up from [@lemonmade])

## [1.5.0] - 2016-04-18

### Added
- report resolver errors at the top of the linted file
- add [`no-namespace`] rule ([#239], thanks [@singles])
- add [`no-named-as-default-member`] rule ([#243], thanks [@dmnd])

### Changed
- Rearranged rule groups in README in preparation for more style guide rules

### Removed
- support for Node 0.10, via `es6-*` ponyfills. Using native Map/Set/Symbol.

## [1.4.0] - 2016-03-25

### Added
- Resolver plugin interface v2: more explicit response format that more clearly covers the found-but-core-module case, where there is no path.
  Still backwards-compatible with the original version of the resolver spec.
- [Resolver documentation](./resolvers/README.md)

### Changed
- using `package.json/files` instead of `.npmignore` for package file inclusion ([#228], thanks [@mathieudutour])
- using `es6-*` ponyfills instead of `babel-runtime`

## [1.3.0] - 2016-03-20

Major perf improvements. Between parsing only once and ignoring gigantic, non-module `node_modules`,
there is very little added time.

My test project takes 17s to lint completely, down from 55s, when using the
memoizing parser, and takes only 27s with naked `babel-eslint` (thus, reparsing local modules).

### Added
- This change log ([#216])
- Experimental memoizing [parser](./memo-parser/README.md)

### Fixed
- Huge reduction in execution time by _only_ ignoring [`import/ignore` setting] if
  something that looks like an `export` is detected in the module content.

## [1.2.0] - 2016-03-19

Thanks [@lencioni] for identifying a huge amount of rework in resolve and kicking
off a bunch of memoization.

I'm seeing 62% improvement over my normal test codebase when executing only
[`no-unresolved`] in isolation, and ~35% total reduction in lint time.

### Changed
- added caching to core/resolve via [#214], configured via [`import/cache` setting]

## [1.1.0] - 2016-03-15

### Added
- Added an [`ignore`](./docs/rules/no-unresolved.md#ignore) option to [`no-unresolved`] for those pesky files that no resolver can find. (still prefer enhancing the Webpack and Node resolvers to using it, though). See [#89] for details.

## [1.0.4] - 2016-03-11

### Changed
- respect hoisting for deep namespaces ([`namespace`]/[`no-deprecated`]) ([#211])

### Fixed
- don't crash on self references ([#210])
- correct cache behavior in `eslint_d` for deep namespaces ([#200])

## [1.0.3] - 2016-02-26

### Changed
- no-deprecated follows deep namespaces ([#191])

### Fixed
- [`namespace`] no longer flags modules with only a default export as having no names. (ns.default is valid ES6)

## [1.0.2] - 2016-02-26

### Fixed
- don't parse imports with no specifiers ([#192])

## [1.0.1] - 2016-02-25

### Fixed
- export `stage-0` shared config
- documented [`no-deprecated`]
- deep namespaces are traversed regardless of how they get imported ([#189])

## [1.0.0] - 2016-02-24

### Added
- [`no-deprecated`]: WIP rule to let you know at lint time if you're using deprecated functions, constants, classes, or modules.

### Changed
- [`namespace`]: support deep namespaces ([#119] via [#157])

## [1.0.0-beta.0] - 2016-02-13

### Changed
- support for (only) ESLint 2.x
- no longer needs/refers to `import/parser` or `import/parse-options`. Instead, ESLint provides the configured parser + options to the rules, and they use that to parse dependencies.

### Removed

- `babylon` as default import parser (see Breaking)

## [0.13.0] - 2016-02-08

### Added
- [`no-commonjs`] rule
- [`no-amd`] rule

### Removed
- Removed vestigial `no-require` rule. [`no-commonjs`] is more complete.

## [0.12.2] - 2016-02-06 [YANKED]

Unpublished from npm and re-released as 0.13.0. See [#170].

## [0.12.1] - 2015-12-17

### Changed
- Broke docs for rules out into individual files.

## [0.12.0] - 2015-12-14

### Changed
- Ignore [`import/ignore` setting] if exports are actually found in the parsed module. Does this to support use of `jsnext:main` in `node_modules` without the pain of managing an allow list or a nuanced deny list.

## [0.11.0] - 2015-11-27

### Added
- Resolver plugins. Now the linter can read Webpack config, properly follow aliases and ignore externals, dismisses inline loaders, etc. etc.!

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/consistent-type-specifier-style.md`
```markdown
# import/consistent-type-specifier-style

🔧 This rule is automatically fixable by the [`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

In both Flow and TypeScript you can mark an import as a type-only import by adding a "kind" marker to the import. Both languages support two positions for marker.

**At the top-level** which marks all names in the import as type-only and applies to named, default, and namespace (for TypeScript) specifiers:

```ts
import type Foo from 'Foo';
import type {Bar} from 'Bar';
// ts only
import type * as Bam from 'Bam';
// flow only
import typeof Baz from 'Baz';
```

**Inline** with to the named import, which marks just the specific name in the import as type-only. An inline specifier is only valid for named specifiers, and not for default or namespace specifiers:

```ts
import {type Foo} from 'Foo';
// flow only
import {typeof Bar} from 'Bar';
```

## Rule Details

This rule either enforces or bans the use of inline type-only markers for named imports.

This rule includes a fixer that will automatically convert your specifiers to the correct form - however the fixer will not respect your preferences around de-duplicating imports. If this is important to you, consider using the [`import/no-duplicates`] rule.

[`import/no-duplicates`]: ./no-duplicates.md

## Options

The rule accepts a single string option which may be one of:

 - `'prefer-inline'` - enforces that named type-only specifiers are only ever written with an inline marker; and never as part of a top-level, type-only import.
 - `'prefer-top-level'` - enforces that named type-only specifiers only ever written as part of a top-level, type-only import; and never with an inline marker.

By default the rule will use the `prefer-inline` option.

## Examples

### `prefer-top-level`

❌ Invalid with `["error", "prefer-top-level"]`

```ts
import {type Foo} from 'Foo';
import Foo, {type Bar} from 'Foo';
// flow only
import {typeof Foo} from 'Foo';
```

✅ Valid with `["error", "prefer-top-level"]`

```ts
import type {Foo} from 'Foo';
import type Foo, {Bar} from 'Foo';
// flow only
import typeof {Foo} from 'Foo';
```

### `prefer-inline`

❌ Invalid with `["error", "prefer-inline"]`

```ts
import type {Foo} from 'Foo';
import type Foo, {Bar} from 'Foo';
// flow only
import typeof {Foo} from 'Foo';
```

✅ Valid with `["error", "prefer-inline"]`

```ts
import {type Foo} from 'Foo';
import Foo, {type Bar} from 'Foo';
// flow only
import {typeof Foo} from 'Foo';
```

## When Not To Use It

If you aren't using Flow or TypeScript 4.5+, then this rule does not apply and need not be used.

If you don't care about, and don't want to standardize how named specifiers are imported then you should not use this rule.

```markdown
# import/default

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ❗ `errors`, ☑️ `recommended`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

If a default import is requested, this rule will report if there is no default
export in the imported module.

For [ES7], reports if a default is named and exported but is not found in the
referenced module.

Note: for packages, the plugin will find exported names
from [`jsnext:main`], if present in `package.json`.
Redux's npm module includes this key, and thereby is lintable, for example.

A module path that is [ignored] or not [unambiguously an ES module] will not be reported when imported.

[ignored]: ../README.md#importignore
[unambiguously an ES module]: https://github.com/bmeck/UnambiguousJavaScriptGrammar

## Rule Details

Given:

```js
// ./foo.js
export default function () { return 42 }

// ./bar.js
export function bar() { return null }

// ./baz.js
module.exports = function () { /* ... */ }

// node_modules/some-module/index.js
exports.sharedFunction = function shared() { /* ... */ }
```

The following is considered valid:

```js
import foo from './foo'

// assuming 'node_modules' are ignored (true by default)
import someModule from 'some-module'
```

...and the following cases are reported:

```js
import bar from './bar' // no default export found in ./bar
import baz from './baz' // no default export found in ./baz
```

## When Not To Use It

If you are using CommonJS and/or modifying the exported namespace of any module at
runtime, you will likely see false positives with this rule.

This rule currently does not interpret `module.exports = ...` as a `default` export,
either, so such a situation will be reported in the importing module.

```markdown
# import/dynamic-import-chunkname

💡 This rule is manually fixable by [editor suggestions](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/core-concepts#rule-suggestions).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

This rule reports any dynamic imports without a webpackChunkName specified in a leading block comment in the proper format.

This rule enforces naming of webpack chunks in dynamic imports. When you don't explicitly name chunks, webpack will autogenerate chunk names that are not consistent across builds, which prevents long-term browser caching.

## Rule Details

This rule runs against `import()` by default, but can be configured to also run against an alternative dynamic-import function, e.g. 'dynamicImport.'
You can also configure the regex format you'd like to accept for the webpackChunkName - for example, if we don't want the number 6 to show up in our chunk names:

 ```javascript
{
  "import/dynamic-import-chunkname": [2, {
    importFunctions: ["dynamicImport"],
    webpackChunknameFormat: "[a-zA-Z0-57-9-/_]+",
    allowEmpty: false
  }]
}
```

### invalid

The following patterns are invalid:

```javascript
// no leading comment
import('someModule');

// incorrectly formatted comment
import(
  /*webpackChunkName:"someModule"*/
  'someModule',
);
import(
  /* webpackChunkName : "someModule" */
  'someModule',
);

// chunkname contains a 6 (forbidden by rule config)
import(
  /* webpackChunkName: "someModule6" */
  'someModule',
);

// invalid syntax for webpack comment
import(
  /* totally not webpackChunkName: "someModule" */
  'someModule',
);

// single-line comment, not a block-style comment
import(
  // webpackChunkName: "someModule"
  'someModule',
);

// chunk names are disallowed when eager mode is set
import(
  /* webpackMode: "eager" */
  /* webpackChunkName: "someModule" */
  'someModule',
)
```

### valid

The following patterns are valid:

```javascript
  import(
    /* webpackChunkName: "someModule" */
    'someModule',
  );
  import(
    /* webpackChunkName: "someOtherModule12345789" */
    'someModule',
  );
  import(
    /* webpackChunkName: "someModule" */
    /* webpackPrefetch: true */
    'someModule',

    'someModule',
  );

  // using single quotes instead of double quotes
  import(
    /* webpackChunkName: 'someModule' */
    'someModule',
  );
```

### `allowEmpty: true`

If you want to allow dynamic imports without a webpackChunkName, you can set `allowEmpty: true` in the rule config. This will allow dynamic imports without a leading comment, or with a leading comment that does not contain a webpackChunkName.

Given `{ "allowEmpty": true }`:

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD024 -- duplicate header -->

### invalid

The following patterns are invalid:

```javascript
// incorrectly formatted comment

## When Not To Use It

If you don't care that webpack will autogenerate chunk names and may blow up browser caches and bundle size reports.

```markdown
# import/enforce-node-protocol-usage

🔧 This rule is automatically fixable by the [`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Enforce either using, or omitting, the `node:` protocol when importing Node.js builtin modules.

## Rule Details

This rule enforces that builtins node imports are using, or omitting, the `node:` protocol.

Determining whether a specifier is a core module depends on the node version being used to run `eslint`.
This version can be specified in the configuration with the [`import/node-version` setting](../../README.md#importnode-version).

Reasons to prefer using the protocol include:

 - the code is more explicitly and clearly referencing a Node.js built-in module

Reasons to prefer omitting the protocol include:

 - some tools don't support the `node:` protocol
 - the code is more portable, because import maps and automatic polyfilling can be used

## Options

The rule requires a single string option which may be one of:

 - `'always'` - enforces that builtins node imports are using the `node:` protocol.
 - `'never'` - enforces that builtins node imports are not using the `node:` protocol.

## Examples

### `'always'`

❌ Invalid

```js
import fs from 'fs';
export { promises } from 'fs';
// require
const fs = require('fs/promises');
```

✅ Valid

```js
import fs from 'node:fs';
export { promises } from 'node:fs';
import * as test from 'node:test';
// require
const fs = require('node:fs/promises');
```

### `'never'`

❌ Invalid

```js
import fs from 'node:fs';
export { promises } from 'node:fs';
// require
const fs = require('node:fs/promises');
```

✅ Valid

```js
import fs from 'fs';
export { promises } from 'fs';

// require
const fs = require('fs/promises');

// This rule will not enforce not using `node:` protocol when the module is only available under the `node:` protocol.
import * as test from 'node:test';
```

## When Not To Use It

If you don't want to consistently enforce using, or omitting, the `node:` protocol when importing Node.js builtin modules.

```

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/export.md`
```markdown
# import/export

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ❗ `errors`, ☑️ `recommended`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Reports funny business with exports, like repeated exports of names or defaults.

## Rule Details

```js
export default class MyClass { /*...*/ } // Multiple default exports.

function makeClass() { return new MyClass(...arguments) }

export default makeClass // Multiple default exports.
```

or

```js
export const foo = function () { /*...*/ } // Multiple exports of name 'foo'.

function bar() { /*...*/ }
export { bar as foo } // Multiple exports of name 'foo'.
```

In the case of named/default re-export, all `n` re-exports will be reported,
as at least `n-1` of them are clearly mistakes, but it is not clear which one
(if any) is intended. Could be the result of copy/paste, code duplication with
intent to rename, etc.

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/exports-last.md`
```markdown
# import/exports-last

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

This rule enforces that all exports are declared at the bottom of the file. This rule will report any export declarations that comes before any non-export statements.

## This will be reported

```JS

const bool = true

export default bool

const str = 'foo'

```

```JS

export const bool = true

const str = 'foo'

```

## This will not be reported

```JS
const arr = ['bar']

export const bool = true

export default bool

export function func() {
  console.log('Hello World 🌍')
}

export const str = 'foo'
```

## When Not To Use It

If you don't mind exports being sprinkled throughout a file, you may not want to enable this rule.

### ES6 exports only

The exports-last rule is currently only working on ES6 exports. You may not want to enable this rule if you're using CommonJS exports.

If you need CommonJS support feel free to open an issue or create a PR.

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/extensions.md`
```markdown
# import/extensions

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Some file resolve algorithms allow you to omit the file extension within the import source path. For example the `node` resolver (which does not yet support ESM/`import`) can resolve `./foo/bar` to the absolute path `/User/someone/foo/bar.js` because the `.js` extension is resolved automatically by default in CJS. Depending on the resolver you can configure more extensions to get resolved automatically.

In order to provide a consistent use of file extensions across your code base, this rule can enforce or disallow the use of certain file extensions.

## Rule Details

This rule either takes one string option, one object option, or a string and an object option. If it is the string `"never"` (the default value), then the rule forbids the use for any extension. If it is the string `"always"`, then the rule enforces the use of extensions for all import statements. If it is the string `"ignorePackages"`, then the rule enforces the use of extensions for all import statements except package imports.

```jsonc
"import/extensions": [<severity>, "never" | "always" | "ignorePackages"]
```

By providing an object you can configure each extension separately.

```jsonc
"import/extensions": [<severity>, {
  <extension>: "never" | "always" | "ignorePackages"
}]
```

 For example `{ "js": "always", "json": "never" }` would always enforce the use of the `.js` extension but never allow the use of the `.json` extension.

By providing both a string and an object, the string will set the default setting for all extensions, and the object can be used to set granular overrides for specific extensions.

```jsonc
"import/extensions": [
  <severity>,
  "never" | "always" | "ignorePackages",
  {
    <extension>: "never" | "always" | "ignorePackages"
  }
]
```

For example, `["error", "never", { "svg": "always" }]` would require that all extensions are omitted, except for "svg".

`ignorePackages` can be set as a separate boolean option like this:

```jsonc
"import/extensions": [
  <severity>,
  "never" | "always" | "ignorePackages",
  {
    ignorePackages: true | false,
    pattern: {
      <extension>: "never" | "always" | "ignorePackages"
    }
  }
]
```

In that case, if you still want to specify extensions, you can do so inside the **pattern** property.
Default value of `ignorePackages` is `false`.

By default, `import type` and `export type` style imports/exports are ignored. If you want to check them as well, you can set the `checkTypeImports` option to `true`.

Unfortunately, in more advanced linting setups, such as when employing custom specifier aliases (e.g. you're using `eslint-import-resolver-alias`, `paths` in `tsconfig.json`, etc), this rule can be too coarse-grained when determining which imports to ignore and on which to enforce the config.
This is especially troublesome if you have import specifiers that [look like externals or builtins](./order.md#how-imports-are-grouped).

Set `pathGroupOverrides` to force this rule to always ignore certain imports and never ignore others.
`pathGroupOverrides` accepts an array of one or more [`PathGroupOverride`](#pathgroupoverride) objects.

For example:

```jsonc
"import/extensions": [
  <severity>,
  "never" | "always" | "ignorePackages",
  {
    ignorePackages: true | false,
    pattern: {
      <extension>: "never" | "always" | "ignorePackages"
    },
    pathGroupOverrides: [
      {
        pattern: "package-name-to-ignore",
        action: "ignore",
      },
      {
        pattern: "bespoke+alias:{*,*/**}",
        action: "enforce",
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

> \[!NOTE]
>
> `pathGroupOverrides` is inspired by [`pathGroups` in `'import/order'`](./order.md#pathgroups) and shares a similar interface.
> If you're using `pathGroups` already, you may find `pathGroupOverrides` very useful.

### `PathGroupOverride`

|     property     | required |          type           | description                                                     |
| :--------------: | :------: | :---------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     `pattern`    |    ☑️     |        `string`         | [Minimatch pattern][16] for specifier matching                  |
| `patternOptions` |          |        `object`         | [Minimatch options][17]; default: `{nocomment: true}`           |
|      `action`    |    ☑️     | `"enforce" \| "ignore"` | What action to take on imports whose specifiers match `pattern` |

### Exception

When disallowing the use of certain extensions this rule makes an exception and allows the use of extension when the file would not be resolvable without extension.

For example, given the following folder structure:

```pt
├── foo
│   ├── bar.js
│   ├── bar.json
```

and this import statement:

```js
import bar from './foo/bar.json';
```

then the extension can’t be omitted because it would then resolve to `./foo/bar.js`.

### Examples

The following patterns are considered problems when configuration set to "never":

```js
import foo from './foo.js';

import bar from './bar.json';

import Component from './Component.jsx';

import express from 'express/index.js';
```

The following patterns are not considered problems when configuration set to "never":

```js
import foo from './foo';

import bar from './bar';

import Component from './Component';

import express from 'express/index';

import * as path from 'path';
```

The following patterns are considered problems when the configuration is set to "never" and the option "checkTypeImports" is set to `true`:

```js
import type { Foo } from './foo.ts';

export type { Foo } from './foo.ts';
```

The following patterns are considered problems when configuration set to "always":

```js
import foo from './foo';

import bar from './bar';

import Component from './Component';

import foo from '@/foo';
```

The following patterns are not considered problems when configuration set to "always":

```js
import foo from './foo.js';

import bar from './bar.json';

import Component from './Component.jsx';

import * as path from 'path';

import foo from '@/foo.js';
```

The following patterns are considered problems when configuration set to "ignorePackages":

```js
import foo from './foo';

import bar from './bar';

import Component from './Component';

```

The following patterns are not considered problems when configuration set to "ignorePackages":

```js
import foo from './foo.js';

import bar from './bar.json';

import Component from './Component.jsx';

import express from 'express';

import foo from '@/foo'
```

The following patterns are not considered problems when configuration set to `['error', 'always', {ignorePackages: true} ]`:

```js
import Component from './Component.jsx';

import baz from 'foo/baz.js';

import express from 'express';

import foo from '@/foo';
```

The following patterns are considered problems when the configuration is set to "always" and the option "checkTypeImports" is set to `true`:

```js
import type { Foo } from './foo';

export type { Foo } from './foo';
```

## When Not To Use It

If you are not concerned about a consistent usage of file extension.

In the future, when this rule supports native node ESM resolution, and the plugin is configured to use native rather than transpiled ESM (a config option that is not yet available) - setting this to `always` will have no effect.

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/first.md`
```markdown
# import/first

🔧 This rule is automatically fixable by the [`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

This rule reports any imports that come after non-import
statements.

## Rule Details

```js
import foo from './foo'

// some module-level initializer
initWith(foo)

import bar from './bar' // <- reported
```

Providing `absolute-first` as an option will report any absolute imports (i.e.
packages) that come after any relative imports:

```js
import foo from 'foo'
import bar from './bar'

import * as _ from 'lodash' // <- reported
```

If you really want import type ordering, check out [`import/order`].

Notably, `import`s are hoisted, which means the imported modules will be evaluated
before any of the statements interspersed between them. Keeping all `import`s together
at the top of the file may prevent surprises resulting from this part of the spec.

### On directives

Directives are allowed as long as they occur strictly before any `import` declarations,
as follows:

```js
'use super-mega-strict'

import { suchFoo } from 'lame-fake-module-name'  // no report here
```

A directive in this case is assumed to be a single statement that contains only
a literal string-valued expression.

`'use strict'` would be a good example, except that [modules are always in strict
mode](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/#sec-strict-mode-code) so it would be surprising to see a `'use strict'` sharing a file with `import`s and
`export`s.

Given that, see [#255] for the reasoning.

### With Fixer

This rule contains a fixer to reorder in-body import to top, the following criteria applied:

1. Never re-order relative to each other, even if `absolute-first` is set.
2. If an import creates an identifier, and that identifier is referenced at module level *before* the import itself, that won't be re-ordered.

## When Not To Use It

If you don't mind imports being sprinkled throughout, you may not want to
enable this rule.

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/group-exports.md`
```markdown
# import/group-exports

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Reports when named exports are not grouped together in a single `export` declaration or when multiple assignments to CommonJS `module.exports` or `exports` object are present in a single file.

**Rationale:** An `export` declaration or `module.exports` assignment can appear anywhere in the code. By requiring a single export declaration all your exports will remain at one place, making it easier to see what exports a module provides.

## Rule Details

This rule warns whenever a single file contains multiple named export declarations or multiple assignments to `module.exports` (or `exports`).

### Valid

```js
// A single named export declaration -> ok
export const valid = true
```

```js
const first = true
const second = true

// A single named export declaration -> ok
export {
  first,
  second,
}
```

```js
// Aggregating exports -> ok
export { default as module1 } from 'module-1'
export { default as module2 } from 'module-2'
```

```js
// A single exports assignment -> ok
module.exports = {
  first: true,
  second: true
}
```

```js
const first = true
const second = true

// A single exports assignment -> ok
module.exports = {
  first,
  second,
}
```

```js
function test() {}
test.property = true
test.another = true

// A single exports assignment -> ok
module.exports = test
```

```ts
const first = true;
type firstType = boolean

// A single named export declaration (type exports handled separately) -> ok
export {first}
export type {firstType}
```

### Invalid

```js
// Multiple named export statements -> not ok!
export const first = true
export const second = true
```

```js
// Aggregating exports from the same module -> not ok!
export { module1 } from 'module-1'
export { module2 } from 'module-1'
```

```js
// Multiple exports assignments -> not ok!
exports.first = true
exports.second = true
```

```js
// Multiple exports assignments -> not ok!
module.exports = {}
module.exports.first = true
```

```js
// Multiple exports assignments -> not ok!
module.exports = () => {}
module.exports.first = true
module.exports.second = true
```

```ts
type firstType = boolean
type secondType = any

// Multiple named type export statements -> not ok!
export type {firstType}
export type {secondType}
```

## When Not To Use It

If you do not mind having your exports spread across the file, you can safely turn this rule off.

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/max-dependencies.md`
```markdown
# import/max-dependencies

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Forbid modules to have too many dependencies (`import` or `require` statements).

This is a useful rule because a module with too many dependencies is a code smell, and usually indicates the module is doing too much and/or should be broken up into smaller modules.

Importing multiple named exports from a single module will only count once (e.g. `import {x, y, z} from './foo'` will only count as a single dependency).

## Options

This rule has the following options, with these defaults:

```js
"import/max-dependencies": ["error", {
  "max": 10,
  "ignoreTypeImports": false,
}]
```

### `max`

This option sets the maximum number of dependencies allowed. Anything over will trigger the rule. **Default is 10** if the rule is enabled and no `max` is specified.

Given a max value of `{"max": 2}`:

### Fail

```js
import a from './a'; // 1
const b = require('./b'); // 2
import c from './c'; // 3 - exceeds max!
```

### Pass

```js
import a from './a'; // 1
const anotherA = require('./a'); // still 1
import {x, y, z} from './foo'; // 2
```

### `ignoreTypeImports`

Ignores `type` imports. Type imports are a feature released in TypeScript 3.8, you can [read more here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-8.html#type-only-imports-and-export). Defaults to `false`.

Given `{"max": 2, "ignoreTypeImports": true}`:

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD024 -- duplicate header -->
### Fail

```ts
import a from './a';
import b from './b';
import c from './c';
```

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD024 -- duplicate header -->
### Pass

```ts
import a from './a';
import b from './b';
import type c from './c'; // Doesn't count against max
```

## When Not To Use It

import { notFoo } from './foo'

// ES7 proposal
export { notFoo as defNotBar } from './foo'

// will follow 'jsnext:main', if available
import { dontCreateStore } from 'redux'
```

### Settings

[`import/ignore`] can be provided as a setting to ignore certain modules (node_modules,
CoffeeScript, CSS if using Webpack, etc.).

Given:

```yaml
# .eslintrc (YAML)
---
settings:
  import/ignore:
    - node_modules  # included by default, but replaced if explicitly configured
    - *.coffee$     # can't parse CoffeeScript (unless a custom polyglot parser was configured)
```

and

```coffeescript
# ./whatever.coffee
exports.whatever = (foo) -> console.log foo
```

then the following is not reported:

```js
// ./foo.js

// can't be analyzed, and ignored, so not reported
import { notWhatever } from './whatever'
```

## When Not To Use It

If you are using CommonJS and/or modifying the exported namespace of any module at
runtime, you will likely see false positives with this rule.

```markdown
# import/namespace

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ❗ `errors`, ☑️ `recommended`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Enforces names exist at the time they are dereferenced, when imported as a full namespace (i.e. `import * as foo from './foo'; foo.bar();` will report if `bar` is not exported by `./foo`.).

Will report at the import declaration if there are _no_ exported names found.

Also, will report for computed references (i.e. `foo["bar"]()`).

Reports on assignment to a member of an imported namespace.

Note: for packages, the plugin will find exported names
from [`jsnext:main`], if present in `package.json`.
Redux's npm module includes this key, and thereby is lintable, for example.

A module path that is [ignored] or not [unambiguously an ES module] will not be reported when imported.

[ignored]: ../README.md#importignore
[unambiguously an ES module]: https://github.com/bmeck/UnambiguousJavaScriptGrammar

## Rule Details

Currently, this rule does not check for possible
redefinition of the namespace in an intermediate scope. Adherence to the ESLint
`no-shadow` rule for namespaces will prevent this from being a problem.

For [ES7], reports if an exported namespace would be empty (no names exported from the referenced module.)

Given:

```js
// @module ./named-exports
export const a = 1
const b = 2
export { b }

const c = 3
export { c as d }

export class ExportedClass { }

// ES7
export * as deep from './deep'
```

and:

```js
// @module ./deep
export const e = "MC2"
```

See what is valid and reported:

```js
// @module ./foo
import * as names from './named-exports'

function great() {
  return names.a + names.b  // so great https://youtu.be/ei7mb8UxEl8
}

function notGreat() {
  doSomethingWith(names.c) // Reported: 'c' not found in imported namespace 'names'.

  const { a, b, c } = names // also reported, only for 'c'
}

// also tunnels through re-exported namespaces!
function deepTrouble() {
  doSomethingWith(names.deep.e) // fine
  doSomethingWith(names.deep.f) // Reported: 'f' not found in deeply imported namespace 'names.deep'.
}

```

### Options

#### `allowComputed`

Defaults to `false`. When false, will report the following:

```js
/*eslint import/namespace: [2, { allowComputed: false }]*/
import * as a from './a'

function f(x) {
  return a[x] // Unable to validate computed reference to imported namespace 'a'.
}
```

When set to `true`, the above computed namespace member reference is allowed, but
still can't be statically analyzed any further.

```markdown
# import/newline-after-import

🔧 This rule is automatically fixable by the [`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Enforces having one or more empty lines after the last top-level import statement or require call.

## Rule Details

This rule supports the following options:

 - `count` which sets the number of newlines that are enforced after the last top-level import statement or require call. This option defaults to `1`.

 - `exactCount` which enforce the exact numbers of newlines that is mentioned in `count`. This option defaults to `false`.

 - `considerComments` which enforces the rule on comments after the last import-statement as well when set to true. This option defaults to `false`.

Valid:

```js
import defaultExport from './foo';

const FOO = 'BAR';
```

```js
import defaultExport from './foo';
import { bar }  from 'bar-lib';

const FOO = 'BAR';
```

```js
const FOO = require('./foo');
const BAR = require('./bar');

const BAZ = 1;
```

Invalid:

```js
import * as foo from 'foo'
const FOO = 'BAR';
```

```js
import * as foo from 'foo';
const FOO = 'BAR';

import { bar }  from 'bar-lib';
```

```js
const FOO = require('./foo');
const BAZ = 1;
const BAR = require('./bar');
```

With `count` set to `2` this will be considered valid:

```js
import defaultExport from './foo';


const FOO = 'BAR';
```

```js
import defaultExport from './foo';



const FOO = 'BAR';
```

With `count` set to `2` these will be considered invalid:

```js
import defaultExport from './foo';
const FOO = 'BAR';
```

```js
import defaultExport from './foo';

const FOO = 'BAR';
```

With `count` set to `2` and `exactCount` set to `true` this will be considered valid:

```js
import defaultExport from './foo';


const FOO = 'BAR';
```

With `count` set to `2` and `exactCount` set to `true` these will be considered invalid:

```js
import defaultExport from './foo';
const FOO = 'BAR';
```

```js
import defaultExport from './foo';

const FOO = 'BAR';
```

```js
import defaultExport from './foo';



const FOO = 'BAR';
```

```js
import defaultExport from './foo';




const FOO = 'BAR';
```

With `considerComments` set to `false` this will be considered valid:

```js
import defaultExport from './foo'
// some comment here.
const FOO = 'BAR'
```

With `considerComments` set to `true` this will be considered valid:

```js
import defaultExport from './foo'

// some comment here.
const FOO = 'BAR'
```

With `considerComments` set to `true` this will be considered invalid:

```js
import defaultExport from './foo'
// some comment here.
const FOO = 'BAR'
```

## Example options usage

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "import/newline-after-import": ["error", { "count": 2 }]
  }
}
```

## When Not To Use It

If you like to visually group module imports with its usage, you don't want to use this rule.

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-absolute-path.md`
```markdown
# import/no-absolute-path

🔧 This rule is automatically fixable by the [`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Node.js allows the import of modules using an absolute path such as `/home/xyz/file.js`. That is a bad practice as it ties the code using it to your computer, and therefore makes it unusable in packages distributed on `npm` for instance.

This rule forbids the import of modules using absolute paths.

## Rule Details

### Fail

```js
import f from '/foo';
import f from '/some/path';

var f = require('/foo');
var f = require('/some/path');
```

### Pass

```js
import _ from 'lodash';
import foo from 'foo';
import foo from './foo';

var _ = require('lodash');
var foo = require('foo');
var foo = require('./foo');
```

### Options

By default, only ES6 imports and CommonJS `require` calls will have this rule enforced.

You may provide an options object providing true/false for any of

 - `esmodule`: defaults to `true`
 - `commonjs`: defaults to `true`
 - `amd`: defaults to `false`

If `{ amd: true }` is provided, dependency paths for AMD-style `define` and `require`
calls will be resolved:

```js
/*eslint import/no-absolute-path: [2, { commonjs: false, amd: true }]*/
define(['/foo'], function (foo) { /*...*/ }) // reported
require(['/foo'], function (foo) { /*...*/ }) // reported

const foo = require('/foo') // ignored because of explicit `commonjs: false`
```

```

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-amd.md`
```markdown
# import/no-amd

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Reports `require([array], ...)` and `define([array], ...)` function calls at the
module scope. Will not report if !=2 arguments, or first argument is not a literal array.

Intended for temporary use when migrating to pure ES6 modules.

## Rule Details

This will be reported:

```js
define(["a", "b"], function (a, b) { /* ... */ })

require(["b", "c"], function (b, c) { /* ... */ })
```

CommonJS `require` is still valid.

## When Not To Use It

If you don't mind mixing module systems (sometimes this is useful), you probably
don't want this rule.

It is also fairly noisy if you have a larger codebase that is being transitioned
from AMD to ES6 modules.

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-anonymous-default-export.md`
```markdown
# import/no-anonymous-default-export

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Reports if a module's default export is unnamed. This includes several types of unnamed data types; literals, object expressions, arrays, anonymous functions, arrow functions, and anonymous class declarations.

Ensuring that default exports are named helps improve the grepability of the codebase by encouraging the re-use of the same identifier for the module's default export at its declaration site and at its import sites.

## Options

By default, all types of anonymous default exports are forbidden, but any types can be selectively allowed by toggling them on in the options.

The complete default configuration looks like this.

```js
"import/no-anonymous-default-export": ["error", {
  "allowArray": false,
  "allowArrowFunction": false,
  "allowAnonymousClass": false,
  "allowAnonymousFunction": false,
  "allowCallExpression": true, // The true value here is for backward compatibility
  "allowNew": false,
  "allowLiteral": false,
  "allowObject": false
}]
```

## Rule Details

### Fail

```js
export default []

export default () => {}

export default class {}

export default function () {}

/* eslint import/no-anonymous-default-export: [2, {"allowCallExpression": false}] */
export default foo(bar)

export default 123

export default {}

export default new Foo()
```

### Pass

```js
const foo = 123
export default foo

export default class MyClass() {}

export default function foo() {}

/* eslint import/no-anonymous-default-export: [2, {"allowArray": true}] */
export default []

/* eslint import/no-anonymous-default-export: [2, {"allowArrowFunction": true}] */
export default () => {}

/* eslint import/no-anonymous-default-export: [2, {"allowAnonymousClass": true}] */
export default class {}

/* eslint import/no-anonymous-default-export: [2, {"allowAnonymousFunction": true}] */
export default function () {}

export default foo(bar)

/* eslint import/no-anonymous-default-export: [2, {"allowLiteral": true}] */
export default 123

/* eslint import/no-anonymous-default-export: [2, {"allowObject": true}] */
export default {}

/* eslint import/no-anonymous-default-export: [2, {"allowNew": true}] */
export default new Foo()
```

```

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-commonjs.md`
```markdown
# import/no-commonjs

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Reports `require([string])` function calls. Will not report if >1 argument,
or single argument is not a literal string.

Reports `module.exports` or `exports.*`, also.

Intended for temporary use when migrating to pure ES6 modules.

## Rule Details

This will be reported:

```js
var mod = require('./mod')
  , common = require('./common')
  , fs = require('fs')
  , whateverModule = require('./not-found')

module.exports = { a: "b" }
exports.c = "d"
```

### Allow require

If `allowRequire` option is set to `true`, `require` calls are valid:

```js
/*eslint no-commonjs: [2, { allowRequire: true }]*/
var mod = require('./mod');
```

but `module.exports` is reported as usual.

### Allow conditional require

By default, conditional requires are allowed:

```js
var a = b && require("c")

if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
  require('that-ugly-thing');
}

var fs = null;
try {
  fs = require("fs")
} catch (error) {}
```

If the `allowConditionalRequire` option is set to `false`, they will be reported.

If you don't rely on synchronous module loading, check out [dynamic import](https://github.com/airbnb/babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node).

### Allow primitive modules

If `allowPrimitiveModules` option is set to `true`, the following is valid:

```js
/*eslint no-commonjs: [2, { allowPrimitiveModules: true }]*/

module.exports = "foo"
module.exports = function rule(context) { return { /* ... */ } }
```

but this is still reported:

```js
/*eslint no-commonjs: [2, { allowPrimitiveModules: true }]*/

module.exports = { x: "y" }
exports.z = function boop() { /* ... */ }
```

This is useful for things like ESLint rule modules, which must export a function as
the module.

## When Not To Use It

If you don't mind mixing module systems (sometimes this is useful), you probably
don't want this rule.

It is also fairly noisy if you have a larger codebase that is being transitioned
from CommonJS to ES6 modules.

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-cycle.md`
```markdown
# import/no-cycle

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Ensures that there is no resolvable path back to this module via its dependencies.

This includes cycles of depth 1 (imported module imports me) to `"∞"` (or `Infinity`), if the
[`maxDepth`](#maxdepth) option is not set.

```js
// dep-b.js
import './dep-a.js'

export function b() { /* ... */ }
```

```js
// dep-a.js
import { b } from './dep-b.js' // reported: Dependency cycle detected.
```

This rule does _not_ detect imports that resolve directly to the linted module;
for that, see [`no-self-import`].

This rule ignores type-only imports in Flow and TypeScript syntax (`import type` and `import typeof`), which have no runtime effect.

## Rule Details

### Options

By default, this rule only detects cycles for ES6 imports, but see the [`no-unresolved` options](./no-unresolved.md#options) as this rule also supports the same `commonjs` and `amd` flags. However, these flags only impact which import types are _linted_; the
import/export infrastructure only registers `import` statements in dependencies, so
cycles created by `require` within imported modules may not be detected.

#### `maxDepth`

There is a `maxDepth` option available to prevent full expansion of very deep dependency trees:

```js
/*eslint import/no-cycle: [2, { maxDepth: 1 }]*/

// dep-c.js
import './dep-a.js'
```

```js
// dep-b.js
import './dep-c.js'

export function b() { /* ... */ }
```

```js
// dep-a.js
import { b } from './dep-b.js' // not reported as the cycle is at depth 2
```

This is not necessarily recommended, but available as a cost/benefit tradeoff mechanism
for reducing total project lint time, if needed.

#### `ignoreExternal`

An `ignoreExternal` option is available to prevent the cycle detection to expand to external modules:

```js
/*eslint import/no-cycle: [2, { ignoreExternal: true }]*/

// dep-a.js
import 'module-b/dep-b.js'

export function a() { /* ... */ }
```

```js
// node_modules/module-b/dep-b.js
import { a } from './dep-a.js' // not reported as this module is external
```

Its value is `false` by default, but can be set to `true` for reducing total project lint time, if needed.

#### `allowUnsafeDynamicCyclicDependency`

This option disable reporting of errors if a cycle is detected with at least one dynamic import.

```js
// bar.js
import { foo } from './foo';
export const bar = foo;

// foo.js
export const foo = 'Foo';
export function getBar() { return import('./bar'); }
```

> Cyclic dependency are **always** a dangerous anti-pattern as discussed extensively in [#2265](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/issues/2265). Please be extra careful about using this option.

#### `disableScc`

This option disables a pre-processing step that calculates [Strongly Connected Components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component), which are used for avoiding unnecessary work checking files in different SCCs for cycles.

However, under some configurations, this pre-processing may be more expensive than the time it saves.

When this option is `true`, we don't calculate any SCC graph, and check all files for cycles (leading to higher time-complexity). Default is `false`.

## When Not To Use It

This rule is comparatively computationally expensive. If you are pressed for lint
time, or don't think you have an issue with dependency cycles, you may not want
this rule enabled.

# import/no-default-export

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Prohibit default exports. Mostly an inverse of [`prefer-default-export`].

[`prefer-default-export`]: ./prefer-default-export.md

## Rule Details

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```javascript
// bad1.js

// There is a default export.
export const foo = 'foo';
const bar = 'bar';
export default 'bar';
```

```javascript
// bad2.js

// There is a default export.
const foo = 'foo';
export { foo as default }
```

The following patterns are not warnings:

```javascript
// good1.js

// There is only a single module export and it's a named export.
export const foo = 'foo';
```

```javascript
// good2.js

// There is more than one named export in the module.
export const foo = 'foo';
export const bar = 'bar';
```

```javascript
// good3.js

// There is more than one named export in the module
const foo = 'foo';
const bar = 'bar';
export { foo, bar }
```

```javascript
// export-star.js

// Any batch export will disable this rule. The remote module is not inspected.
export * from './other-module'
```

## When Not To Use It

If you don't care if default imports are used, or if you prefer default imports over named imports.

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-deprecated.md`
```markdown
# import/no-deprecated

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Reports use of a deprecated name, as indicated by a JSDoc block with a `@deprecated`
tag or TomDoc `Deprecated:` comment.

using a JSDoc `@deprecated` tag:

```js
// @file: ./answer.js

/**
 * this is what you get when you trust a mouse talk show
 * @deprecated need to restart the experiment
 * @returns {Number} nonsense
 */
export function multiply(six, nine) {
  return 42
}
```

will report as such:

```js
import { multiply } from './answer' // Deprecated: need to restart the experiment

function whatever(y, z) {
  return multiply(y, z) // Deprecated: need to restart the experiment
}
```

or using the TomDoc equivalent:

```js
// Deprecated: This is what you get when you trust a mouse talk show, need to
// restart the experiment.
//
// Returns a Number nonsense
export function multiply(six, nine) {
  return 42
}
```

Only JSDoc is enabled by default. Other documentation styles can be enabled with
the `import/docstyle` setting.

```yaml
# .eslintrc.yml
settings:
  import/docstyle: ['jsdoc', 'tomdoc']
```

## Worklist

 - [x] report explicit imports on the import node
 - [x] support namespaces
   - [x] should bubble up through deep namespaces (#157)
 - [x] report explicit imports at reference time (at the identifier) similar to namespace

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-duplicates.md`
```markdown
# import/no-duplicates

⚠️ This rule _warns_ in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🚸 `warnings`.

🔧 This rule is automatically fixable by the [`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Reports if a resolved path is imported more than once.

ESLint core has a similar rule ([`no-duplicate-imports`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-duplicate-imports)), but this version
is different in two key ways:

1. the paths in the source code don't have to exactly match, they just have to point to the same module on the filesystem. (i.e. `./foo` and `./foo.js`)
2. this version distinguishes Flow `type` imports from standard imports. ([#334](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/pull/334))

## Rule Details

Valid:

```js
import SomeDefaultClass, * as names from './mod'
// Flow `type` import from same module is fine
import type SomeType from './mod'
```

...whereas here, both `./mod` imports will be reported:

```js
import SomeDefaultClass from './mod'

// oops, some other import separated these lines
import foo from './some-other-mod'

import * as names from './mod'

// will catch this too, assuming it is the same target module
import { something } from './mod.js'
```

The motivation is that this is likely a result of two developers importing different
names from the same module at different times (and potentially largely different
locations in the file.) This rule brings both (or n-many) to attention.

### Query Strings

By default, this rule ignores query strings (i.e. paths followed by a question mark), and thus imports from `./mod?a` and `./mod?b` will be considered as duplicates. However you can use the option `considerQueryString` to handle them as different (primarily because browsers will resolve those imports differently).

Config:

```json
"import/no-duplicates": ["error", {"considerQueryString": true}]
```

And then the following code becomes valid:

```js
import minifiedMod from './mod?minify'
import noCommentsMod from './mod?comments=0'
import originalMod from './mod'
```

It will still catch duplicates when using the same module and the exact same query string:

```js
import SomeDefaultClass from './mod?minify'

// This is invalid, assuming `./mod` and `./mod.js` are the same target:
import * from './mod.js?minify'
```

### Inline Type imports

TypeScript 4.5 introduced a new [feature](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-5/#type-on-import-names) that allows mixing of named value and type imports. In order to support fixing to an inline type import when duplicate imports are detected, `prefer-inline` can be set to true.

Config:

```json
"import/no-duplicates": ["error", {"prefer-inline": true}]
```

<!--tabs-->

❌ Invalid `["error", {"prefer-inline": true}]`

```js
import { AValue, type AType } from './mama-mia'
import type { BType } from './mama-mia'

import { CValue } from './papa-mia'
import type { CType } from './papa-mia'
```

✅ Valid with `["error", {"prefer-inline": true}]`

```js
import { AValue, type AType, type BType } from './mama-mia'

import { CValue, type CType } from './papa-mia'
```

<!--tabs-->

## When Not To Use It

If the core ESLint version is good enough (i.e. you're _not_ using Flow and you _are_ using [`import/extensions`](./extensions.md)), keep it and don't use this.

If you like to split up imports across lines or may need to import a default and a namespace,
you may not want to enable this rule.

```

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-dynamic-require.md`
```markdown
# import/no-dynamic-require

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

The `require` method from CommonJS is used to import modules from different files. Unlike the ES6 `import` syntax, it can be given expressions that will be resolved at runtime. While this is sometimes necessary and useful, in most cases it isn't. Using expressions (for instance, concatenating a path and variable) as the argument makes it harder for tools to do static code analysis, or to find where in the codebase a module is used.

This rule forbids every call to `require()` that uses expressions for the module name argument.

## Rule Details

### Fail

```js
require(name);
require('../' + name);
require(`../${name}`);
require(name());
```

### Pass

```js
require('../name');

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-extraneous-dependencies.md`
```markdown
# import/no-extraneous-dependencies

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Forbid the import of external modules that are not declared in the `package.json`'s `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, `optionalDependencies`, `peerDependencies`, or `bundledDependencies`.
The closest parent `package.json` will be used. If no `package.json` is found, the rule will not lint anything. This behavior can be changed with the rule option `packageDir`. Normally ignores imports of modules marked internal, but this can be changed with the rule option `includeInternal`. Type imports can be verified by specifying `includeTypes`.

Modules have to be installed for this rule to work.

## Options

This rule supports the following options:

`devDependencies`: If set to `false`, then the rule will show an error when `devDependencies` are imported. Defaults to `true`.
Type imports are ignored by default.

`optionalDependencies`: If set to `false`, then the rule will show an error when `optionalDependencies` are imported. Defaults to `true`.

`peerDependencies`: If set to `false`, then the rule will show an error when `peerDependencies` are imported. Defaults to `true`.

`bundledDependencies`: If set to `false`, then the rule will show an error when `bundledDependencies` are imported. Defaults to `true`.

You can set the options like this:

```js
"import/no-extraneous-dependencies": ["error", {"devDependencies": false, "optionalDependencies": false, "peerDependencies": false}]
```

You can also use an array of globs instead of literal booleans:

```js
"import/no-extraneous-dependencies": ["error", {"devDependencies": ["**/*.test.js", "**/*.spec.js"]}]
```

When using an array of globs, the setting will be set to `true` (no errors reported) if the name of the file being linted (i.e. not the imported file/module) matches a single glob in the array, and `false` otherwise.

There are 2 boolean options to opt into checking extra imports that are normally ignored: `includeInternal`, which enables the checking of internal modules, and `includeTypes`, which enables checking of type imports in TypeScript.

```js
"import/no-extraneous-dependencies": ["error", {"includeInternal": true, "includeTypes": true}]
```

Also there is one more option called `packageDir`, this option is to specify the path to the folder containing package.json.

If provided as a relative path string, will be computed relative to the current working directory at linter execution time. If this is not ideal (does not work with some editor integrations), consider using `__dirname` to provide a path relative to your configuration.

```js
"import/no-extraneous-dependencies": ["error", {"packageDir": './some-dir/'}]
// or
"import/no-extraneous-dependencies": ["error", {"packageDir": path.join(__dirname, 'some-dir')}]
```

It may also be an array of multiple paths, to support monorepos or other novel project
folder layouts:

```js
"import/no-extraneous-dependencies": ["error", {"packageDir": ['./some-dir/', './root-pkg']}]
```

## Rule Details

Given the following `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "...": "...",
  "dependencies": {
    "builtin-modules": "^1.1.1",
    "lodash.cond": "^4.2.0",

    "eslint": "^2.4.0",
    "eslint-plugin-ava": "^1.3.0",
    "xo": "^0.13.0"
  },
  "optionalDependencies": {
    "lodash.isarray": "^4.0.0"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": ">=15.0.0 <16.0.0"
  },
  "bundledDependencies": [
    "@generated/foo",
  ]
}
```

## Fail

```js
var _ = require('lodash');
import _ from 'lodash';

import react from 'react';

/* eslint import/no-extraneous-dependencies: ["error", {"devDependencies": false}] */
import test from 'ava';
var test = require('ava');

/* eslint import/no-extraneous-dependencies: ["error", {"optionalDependencies": false}] */
import isArray from 'lodash.isarray';
var isArray = require('lodash.isarray');

/* eslint import/no-extraneous-dependencies: ["error", {"bundledDependencies": false}] */
import foo from '"@generated/foo"';
var foo = require('"@generated/foo"');

/* eslint import/no-extraneous-dependencies: ["error", {"includeInternal": true}] */
import foo from './foo';
var foo = require('./foo');

/* eslint import/no-extraneous-dependencies: ["error", {"includeTypes": true}] */
import type { MyType } from 'foo';
```

## Pass

```js
// Builtin and internal modules are fine
var path = require('path');
var foo = require('./foo');

import test from 'ava';
import find from 'lodash.find';
import isArray from 'lodash.isarray';
import foo from '"@generated/foo"';
import type { MyType } from 'foo';

/* eslint import/no-extraneous-dependencies: ["error", {"peerDependencies": true}] */
import react from 'react';
```

## When Not To Use It

If you do not have a `package.json` file in your project.

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-import-module-exports.md`
```markdown
# import/no-import-module-exports

🔧 This rule is automatically fixable by the [`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Reports the use of import declarations with CommonJS exports in any module
except for the [main module](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#main).

If you have multiple entry points or are using `js:next` this rule includes an
`exceptions` option which you can use to exclude those files from the rule.

## Options

### `exceptions`

 - An array of globs. The rule will be omitted from any file that matches a glob
   in the options array. For example, the following setting will omit the rule
   in the `some-file.js` file.

```json
"import/no-import-module-exports": ["error", {
    "exceptions": ["**/*/some-file.js"]
}]
```

## Rule Details

### Fail

```js
import { stuff } from 'starwars'

import * as allThings from 'starwars'
exports.bar = thing

import thing from 'other-thing'
exports.foo = bar

import thing from 'starwars'
const baz = module.exports = thing

```markdown
# import/no-internal-modules

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Use this rule to prevent importing the submodules of other modules.

## Rule Details

This rule has two mutally exclusive options that are arrays of [minimatch/glob patterns](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) patterns:

 - `allow` that include paths and import statements that can be imported with reaching.
 - `forbid` that exclude paths and import statements that can be imported with reaching.

### Examples

Given the following folder structure:

```pt
my-project
├── actions
│   └── getUser.js
│   └── updateUser.js
├── reducer
│   └── index.js
│   └── user.js
├── redux
│   └── index.js
│   └── configureStore.js
└── app
│   └── index.js
│   └── settings.js
└── entry.js
```

And the .eslintrc file:

```json
{
  ...
  "rules": {
    "import/no-internal-modules": [ "error", {
      "allow": [ "**/actions/*", "source-map-support/*" ],
    } ]
  }
}
```

The following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/**
 *  in my-project/entry.js
 */

import { settings } from './app/index'; // Reaching to "./app/index" is not allowed
import userReducer from './reducer/user'; // Reaching to "./reducer/user" is not allowed
import configureStore from './redux/configureStore'; // Reaching to "./redux/configureStore" is not allowed

export { settings } from './app/index'; // Reaching to "./app/index" is not allowed
export * from './reducer/user'; // Reaching to "./reducer/user" is not allowed
```

The following patterns are NOT considered problems:

```js
/**
 *  in my-project/entry.js
 */

import 'source-map-support/register';
import { settings } from '../app';
import getUser from '../actions/getUser';

export * from 'source-map-support/register';
export { settings } from '../app';
```

Given the following folder structure:

```pt
my-project
├── actions
│   └── getUser.js
│   └── updateUser.js
├── reducer
│   └── index.js
│   └── user.js
├── redux
│   └── index.js
│   └── configureStore.js
└── app
│   └── index.js
│   └── settings.js
└── entry.js
```

And the .eslintrc file:

```json
{
  ...
  "rules": {
    "import/no-internal-modules": [ "error", {
      "forbid": [ "**/actions/*", "source-map-support/*" ],
    } ]
  }
}
```

The following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/**
 *  in my-project/entry.js
 */

import 'source-map-support/register';
import getUser from '../actions/getUser';

export * from 'source-map-support/register';
export getUser from '../actions/getUser';
```

The following patterns are NOT considered problems:

```js
/**

 */

import 'source-map-support';
import { getUser } from '../actions';

export * from 'source-map-support';
export { getUser } from '../actions';
```

```

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-mutable-exports.md`
```markdown
# import/no-mutable-exports

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Forbids the use of mutable exports with `var` or `let`.

## Rule Details

Valid:

```js
export const count = 1
export function getCount() {}
export class Counter {}
```

...whereas here exports will be reported:

```js
export let count = 2
export var count = 3

let count = 4
export { count } // reported here
```

## Functions/Classes

Note that exported function/class declaration identifiers may be reassigned,
but are not flagged by this rule at this time. They may be in the future, if a
reassignment is detected, i.e.

```js
// possible future behavior!
export class Counter {} // reported here: exported class is reassigned on line [x].
Counter = KitchenSink // not reported here unless you enable no-class-assign

// this pre-declaration reassignment is valid on account of function hoisting
getCount = function getDuke() {} // not reported here without no-func-assign
export function getCount() {} // reported here: exported function is reassigned on line [x].
```

To prevent general reassignment of these identifiers, exported or not, you may
want to enable the following core ESLint rules:

 - [no-func-assign]
 - [no-class-assign]

[no-func-assign]: https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-func-assign
[no-class-assign]: https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-class-assign

## When Not To Use It

If your environment correctly implements mutable export bindings.

```markdown
# import/no-named-as-default-member

⚠️ This rule _warns_ in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🚸 `warnings`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Reports use of an exported name as a property on the default export.

Rationale: Accessing a property that has a name that is shared by an exported
name from the same module is likely to be a mistake.

Named import syntax looks very similar to destructuring assignment. It's easy to
make the (incorrect) assumption that named exports are also accessible as
properties of the default export.

Furthermore, [in Babel 5 this is actually how things worked][blog]. This was
fixed in Babel 6. Before upgrading an existing codebase to Babel 6, it can be
useful to run this lint rule.

[blog]: https://kentcdodds.com/blog/misunderstanding-es6-modules-upgrading-babel-tears-and-a-solution

## Rule Details

Given:

```js
// foo.js
export default 'foo';
export const bar = 'baz';
```

...this would be valid:

```js
import foo, {bar} from './foo.js';
```

...and the following would be reported:

```js
// Caution: `foo` also has a named export `bar`.
// Check if you meant to write `import {bar} from './foo.js'` instead.
import foo from './foo.js';
const bar = foo.bar;
```

```js
// Caution: `foo` also has a named export `bar`.
// Check if you meant to write `import {bar} from './foo.js'` instead.
import foo from './foo.js';
const {bar} = foo;
```

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-named-as-default.md`
```markdown
# import/no-named-as-default

⚠️ This rule _warns_ in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🚸 `warnings`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Reports use of an exported name as the locally imported name of a default export.

Rationale: using an exported name as the name of the default export is likely...

 - _misleading_: others familiar with `foo.js` probably expect the name to be `foo`
 - _a mistake_: only needed to import `bar` and forgot the brackets (the case that is prompting this)

## Rule Details

Given:

```js
// foo.js
export default 'foo';
export const bar = 'baz';
```

...this would be valid:

```js
import foo from './foo.js';
```

...and this would be reported:

```js
// message: Using exported name 'bar' as identifier for default export.
import bar from './foo.js';
```

For post-ES2015 `export` extensions, this also prevents exporting the default from a referenced module as a name within that module, for the same reasons:

```js
// valid:
export foo from './foo.js';

// message: Using exported name 'bar' as identifier for default export.
export bar from './foo.js';
```

# import/no-relative-packages

🔧 This rule is automatically fixable by the [`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Use this rule to prevent importing packages through relative paths.

It's useful in Yarn/Lerna workspaces, where it's possible to import a sibling package using `../package` relative path, while direct `package` is the correct one.

## Examples

Given the following folder structure:

```pt
my-project
├── packages
│   ├── foo
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── package.json
│   └── bar
│       ├── index.js
│       └── package.json
└── entry.js
```

And the .eslintrc file:

```json
{
  ...
  "rules": {
    "import/no-relative-packages": "error"
  }
}
```

The following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/**
 *  in my-project/packages/foo.js
 */

import bar from '../bar'; // Import sibling package using relative path
import entry from '../../entry.js'; // Import from parent package using relative path

/**
 *  in my-project/entry.js
 */

import bar from './packages/bar'; // Import child package using relative path
```

The following patterns are NOT considered problems:

```js
/**
 *  in my-project/packages/foo.js
 */

import bar from 'bar'; // Import sibling package using package name

/**
 *  in my-project/entry.js
 */

import bar from 'bar'; // Import sibling package using package name
```

```

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-relative-parent-imports.md`
```markdown
# import/no-relative-parent-imports

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Use this rule to prevent imports to folders in relative parent paths.

This rule is useful for enforcing tree-like folder structures instead of complex graph-like folder structures. While this restriction might be a departure from Node's default resolution style, it can lead large, complex codebases to be easier to maintain. If you've ever had debates over "where to put files" this rule is for you.

To fix violations of this rule there are three general strategies. Given this example:

```pt
numbers
└── three.js
add.js
```

```js
// ./add.js
export default function (numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((sum, n) => sum + n, 0);
}

// ./numbers/three.js
import add from '../add'; // violates import/no-relative-parent-imports

export default function three() {
  return add([1, 2]);
}
```

You can,

1. Move the file to be in a sibling folder (or higher) of the dependency.

   `three.js` could be be in the same folder as `add.js`:

   ```pt
   three.js
   add.js
   ```

   or since `add` doesn't have any imports, it could be in it's own directory (namespace):

   ```pt
   math
   └── add.js
   three.js
   ```

2. Pass the dependency as an argument at runtime (dependency injection)

   ```js
   // three.js
   export default function three(add) {
     return add([1, 2]);
   }

   // somewhere else when you use `three.js`:
   import add from './add';
   import three from './numbers/three';
   console.log(three(add));
   ```

3. Make the dependency a package so it's globally available to all files in your project:

   ```js
   import add from 'add'; // from https://www.npmjs.com/package/add
   export default function three() {
     return add([1,2]);
   }
   ```

These are (respectively) static, dynamic & global solutions to graph-like dependency resolution.

## Examples

Given the following folder structure:

```pt
my-project
├── lib
│   ├── a.js
│   └── b.js
└── main.js
```

And the .eslintrc file:

```json
{
  ...
  "rules": {
    "import/no-relative-parent-imports": "error"
  }
}
```

The following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/**
 *  in my-project/lib/a.js
 */

import bar from '../main'; // Import parent file using a relative path
```

The following patterns are NOT considered problems:

```js
/**
 *  in my-project/main.js
 */

import foo from 'foo'; // Import package using module path
import a from './lib/a'; // Import child file using relative path

/**
 *  in my-project/lib/a.js
 */

import b from './b'; // Import sibling file using relative path
```

```

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-restricted-paths.md`
```markdown
# import/no-restricted-paths

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Some projects contain files which are not always meant to be executed in the same environment.
For example consider a web application that contains specific code for the server and some specific code for the browser/client. In this case you don’t want to import server-only files in your client code.

In order to prevent such scenarios this rule allows you to define restricted zones where you can forbid files from being imported if they match a specific path.

## Rule Details

This rule has one option, which is an object containing all `zones` where restrictions will be applied, plus an optional `basePath` used to resolve relative paths within each zone.
The default for `basePath` is the current working directory.

Each zone consists of a `target`, a `from`, and optional `except` and `message` attributes.

 - `target` - Identifies which files are part of the zone. It can be expressed as:
   - A simple directory path, matching all files contained recursively within it
   - A glob pattern
   - An array of any of the two types above
   - *Example: `target: './client'` - this zone consists of all files under the 'client' dir*
 - `from` - Identifies folders from which the zone is not allowed to import. It can be expressed as:
   - A simple directory path, matching all files contained recursively within it
   - A glob pattern
   - An array of only simple directories, or of only glob patterns (mixing both types within the array is not allowed)
   - *Example: `from: './server'` - this zone is not allowed to import anything from the 'server' dir*
 - `except` - Optional. Allows exceptions that would otherwise violate the related `from`. Note that it does not alter the behaviour of `target` in any way.
   - If `from` is an array of glob patterns, `except` must be an array of glob patterns as well.
   - If `from` is an array of simple directories, `except` is relative to `from` and cannot backtrack to a parent directory.
   - *Example: `except: './server/config'` this zone is allowed to import server config, even if it can't import other server code*
 - `message` - Optional. Displayed in case of rule violation.

*Note: The `from` attribute is NOT matched literally against the import path string as it appears in the code. Instead, it's matched against the path to the imported file after it's been resolved against `basePath`.*

### Examples

Given this folder structure:

```pt
.
├── client
│   ├── foo.js
│   └── baz.js
└── server
    └── bar.js
```

And this configuration:

```json
{
  "zones": [
    {
      "target": "./client",
      "from": "./server"
    }
  ]
}
```

:x: The following is considered incorrect:

```js
// client/foo.js
import bar from '../server/bar';
```

:white_check_mark: The following is considered correct:

```js
// server/bar.js
import baz from '../client/baz';
```

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-unassigned-import.md`
```markdown
# import/no-unassigned-import

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

With both CommonJS' `require` and the ES6 modules' `import` syntax, it is possible to import a module but not to use its result. This can be done explicitly by not assigning the module to as variable. Doing so can mean either of the following things:

 - The module is imported but not used
 - The module has side-effects (like [`should`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/should)). Having side-effects, makes it hard to know whether the module is actually used or can be removed. It can also make it harder to test or mock parts of your application.

This rule aims to remove modules with side-effects by reporting when a module is imported but not assigned.

## Options

This rule supports the following option:

`allow`: An Array of globs. The files that match any of these patterns would be ignored/allowed by the linter. This can be useful for some build environments (e.g. css-loader in webpack).

Note that the globs start from the where the linter is executed (usually project root), but not from each file that includes the source. Learn more in both the pass and fail examples below.

## Fail

```js
import 'should'
require('should')

// In <PROJECT_ROOT>/src/app.js
import '../styles/app.css'
// {"allow": ["styles/*.css"]}
```

## Pass

```js
import _ from 'foo'
import _, {foo} from 'foo'
import _, {foo as bar} from 'foo'
import {foo as bar} from 'foo'
import * as _ from 'foo'

const _ = require('foo')
const {foo} = require('foo')
const {foo: bar} = require('foo')
const [a, b] = require('foo')
const _ = require('foo')

// Module is not assigned, but it is used
bar(require('foo'))
require('foo').bar
require('foo').bar()
require('foo')()

// With allow option set
import './style.css' // {"allow": ["**/*.css"]}
import 'babel-register' // {"allow": ["babel-register"]}

// In <PROJECT_ROOT>/src/app.js
import './styles/app.css'
import '../scripts/register.js'
// {"allow": ["src/styles/**", "**/scripts/*.js"]}
```

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-unresolved.md`
```markdown
# import/no-unresolved

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ❗ `errors`, ☑️ `recommended`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Ensures an imported module can be resolved to a module on the local filesystem,
as defined by standard Node `require.resolve` behavior.

See [settings](../../README.md#settings) for customization options for the resolution (i.e.
additional filetypes, `NODE_PATH`, etc.)

This rule can also optionally report on unresolved modules in CommonJS `require('./foo')` calls and AMD `require(['./foo'], function (foo) {...})` and `define(['./foo'], function (foo) {...})`.

To enable this, send `{ commonjs: true/false, amd: true/false }` as a rule option.
Both are disabled by default.

If you are using Webpack, see the section on [resolvers](../../README.md#resolvers).

## Rule Details

### Options

By default, only ES6 imports will be resolved:

```js
/*eslint import/no-unresolved: 2*/
import x from './foo' // reports if './foo' cannot be resolved on the filesystem
```

If `{commonjs: true}` is provided, single-argument `require` calls will be resolved:

```js
/*eslint import/no-unresolved: [2, { commonjs: true }]*/
const { default: x } = require('./foo') // reported if './foo' is not found

require(0) // ignored
require(['x', 'y'], function (x, y) { /*...*/ }) // ignored
```

Similarly, if `{ amd: true }` is provided, dependency paths for `define` and `require`
calls will be resolved:

```js
/*eslint import/no-unresolved: [2, { amd: true }]*/
define(['./foo'], function (foo) { /*...*/ }) // reported if './foo' is not found
require(['./foo'], function (foo) { /*...*/ }) // reported if './foo' is not found

const { default: x } = require('./foo') // ignored
```

Both may be provided, too:

```js
/*eslint import/no-unresolved: [2, { commonjs: true, amd: true }]*/
const { default: x } = require('./foo') // reported if './foo' is not found
define(['./foo'], function (foo) { /*...*/ }) // reported if './foo' is not found
require(['./foo'], function (foo) { /*...*/ }) // reported if './foo' is not found
```

#### `ignore`

This rule has its own ignore list, separate from [`import/ignore`]. This is because you may want to know whether a module can be located, regardless of whether it can be parsed for exports: `node_modules`, CoffeeScript files, etc. are all good to resolve properly, but will not be parsed if configured as such via [`import/ignore`].

To suppress errors from files that may not be properly resolved by your [resolver settings](../../README.md#resolver-plugins), you may add an `ignore` key with an array of `RegExp` pattern strings:

```js
/*eslint import/no-unresolved: [2, { ignore: ['\\.img$'] }]*/

import { x } from './mod' // may be reported, if not resolved to a module

import coolImg from '../../img/coolImg.img' // will not be reported, even if not found
```

#### `caseSensitive`

By default, this rule will report paths whose case do not match the underlying filesystem path, if the FS is not case-sensitive. To disable this behavior, set the `caseSensitive` option to `false`.

```js
/*eslint import/no-unresolved: [2, { caseSensitive: true (default) | false }]*/
const { default: x } = require('./foo') // reported if './foo' is actually './Foo' and caseSensitive: true
```

#### `caseSensitiveStrict`

The `caseSensitive` option does not detect case for the current working directory. The `caseSensitiveStrict` option allows checking `cwd` in resolved path. By default, the option is disabled.

```js
/*eslint import/no-unresolved: [2, { caseSensitiveStrict: true }]*/

// Absolute paths
import Foo from `/Users/fOo/bar/file.js` // reported, /Users/foo/bar/file.js
import Foo from `d:/fOo/bar/file.js` // reported, d:/foo/bar/file.js

// Relative paths, cwd is Users/foo/
import Foo from `./../fOo/bar/file.js` // reported
```

## When Not To Use It

If you're using a module bundler other than Node or Webpack, you may end up with a lot of false positive reports of missing dependencies.

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-unused-modules.md`
```markdown
# import/no-unused-modules

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Reports:

 - modules without any exports
 - individual exports not being statically `import`ed or `require`ed from other modules in the same project
 - dynamic imports are supported if argument is a literal string

## Rule Details

### Usage

In order for this plugin to work, at least one of the options `missingExports` or `unusedExports` must be enabled (see "Options" section below). In the future, these options will be enabled by default (see <https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/issues/1324>)

Example:

```json
"rules": {
  ...otherRules,
  "import/no-unused-modules": [1, {"unusedExports": true}]
}
```

### Options

This rule takes the following option:

 - **`missingExports`**: if `true`, files without any exports are reported (defaults to `false`)
 - **`unusedExports`**: if `true`, exports without any static usage within other modules are reported (defaults to `false`)
 - **`ignoreUnusedTypeExports`**: if `true`, TypeScript type exports without any static usage within other modules are reported (defaults to `false` and has no effect unless `unusedExports` is `true`)
 - **`src`**: an array with files/paths to be analyzed. It only applies to unused exports. Defaults to `process.cwd()`, if not provided
 - **`ignoreExports`**: an array with files/paths for which unused exports will not be reported (e.g module entry points in a published package)

### Example for missing exports

#### The following will be reported

```js
const class MyClass { /*...*/ }

function makeClass() { return new MyClass(...arguments) }
```

#### The following will not be reported

```js
export default function () { /*...*/ }
```

```js
export const foo = function () { /*...*/ }
```

```js
export { foo, bar }
```

```js
export { foo as bar }
```

### Example for unused exports

given file-f:

```js
import { e } from 'file-a'
import { f } from 'file-b'
import * as fileC from  'file-c'
export { default, i0 } from 'file-d' // both will be reported

export const j = 99 // will be reported
```

and file-d:

```js
export const i0 = 9 // will not be reported
export const i1 = 9 // will be reported
export default () => {} // will not be reported
```

and file-c:

```js
export const h = 8 // will not be reported
export default () => {} // will be reported, as export * only considers named exports and ignores default exports
```

and file-b:

```js
import two, { b, c, doAnything } from 'file-a'

export const f = 6 // will not be reported
```

and file-a:

```js
const b = 2
const c = 3
const d = 4

export const a = 1 // will be reported

export { b, c } // will not be reported

export { d as e } // will not be reported

export function doAnything() {
  // some code
}  // will not be reported

export default 5 // will not be reported
```

### Unused exports with `ignoreUnusedTypeExports` set to `true`

The following will not be reported:

```ts
export type Foo = {}; // will not be reported
export interface Foo = {}; // will not be reported
export enum Foo {}; // will not be reported
```

#### Important Note

Exports from files listed as a main file (`main`, `browser`, or `bin` fields in `package.json`) will be ignored by default. This only applies if the `package.json` is not set to `private: true`

## When not to use

If you don't mind having unused files or dead code within your codebase, you can disable this rule

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-useless-path-segments.md`
```markdown
# import/no-useless-path-segments

🔧 This rule is automatically fixable by the [`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Use this rule to prevent unnecessary path segments in import and require statements.

## Rule Details

Given the following folder structure:

```pt
my-project
├── app.js
├── footer.js
├── header.js
└── helpers.js
└── helpers
    └── index.js
├── index.js
└── pages
    ├── about.js
    ├── contact.js
    └── index.js
```

The following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/**
 *  in my-project/app.js
 */

import "./../my-project/pages/about.js"; // should be "./pages/about.js"
import "./../my-project/pages/about"; // should be "./pages/about"
import "../my-project/pages/about.js"; // should be "./pages/about.js"
import "../my-project/pages/about"; // should be "./pages/about"
import "./pages//about"; // should be "./pages/about"
import "./pages/"; // should be "./pages"
import "./pages/index"; // should be "./pages" (except if there is a ./pages.js file)
import "./pages/index.js"; // should be "./pages" (except if there is a ./pages.js file)
```

The following patterns are NOT considered problems:

```js
/**
 *  in my-project/app.js
 */

import "./header.js";
import "./pages";
import "./pages/about";
import ".";
import "..";
import fs from "fs";
```

## Options

### noUselessIndex

If you want to detect unnecessary `/index` or `/index.js` (depending on the specified file extensions, see below) imports in your paths, you can enable the option `noUselessIndex`. By default it is set to `false`:

```js
"import/no-useless-path-segments": ["error", {
  noUselessIndex: true,
}]
```

Additionally to the patterns described above, the following imports are considered problems if `noUselessIndex` is enabled:

```js
// in my-project/app.js
import "./helpers/index"; // should be "./helpers/" (not auto-fixable to `./helpers` because this would lead to an ambiguous import of `./helpers.js` and `./helpers/index.js`)
import "./pages/index"; // should be "./pages" (auto-fixable)
import "./pages/index.js"; // should be "./pages" (auto-fixable)
```

Note: `noUselessIndex` only avoids ambiguous imports for `.js` files if you haven't specified other resolved file extensions. See [Settings: import/extensions](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import#importextensions) for details.

### commonjs

When set to `true`, this rule checks CommonJS imports. Default to `false`.

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/no-webpack-loader-syntax.md`
```markdown
# import/no-webpack-loader-syntax

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Forbid Webpack loader syntax in imports.

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) allows specifying the [loaders](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/) to use in the import source string using a special syntax like this:

```js
var moduleWithOneLoader = require("my-loader!./my-awesome-module");
```

This syntax is non-standard, so it couples the code to Webpack. The recommended way to specify Webpack loader configuration is in a [Webpack configuration file](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/#configuration).

## Rule Details

### Fail

```js
import myModule from 'my-loader!my-module';
import theme from 'style!css!./theme.css';

var myModule = require('my-loader!./my-module');
var theme = require('style!css!./theme.css');
```

### Pass

```js
import myModule from 'my-module';
import theme from './theme.css';

var myModule = require('my-module');
var theme = require('./theme.css');
```

## When Not To Use It

If you have a project that doesn't use Webpack you can safely disable this rule.

```

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/order.md`
```markdown
# import/order

🔧 This rule is automatically fixable by the [`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Enforce a convention in the order of `require()` / `import` statements.

With the [`groups`][18] option set to `["builtin", "external", "internal", "parent", "sibling", "index", "object", "type"]` the order is as shown in the following example:

```ts
// 1. node "builtin" modules
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
// 2. "external" modules
import _ from 'lodash';
import chalk from 'chalk';
// 3. "internal" modules
// (if you have configured your path or webpack to handle your internal paths differently)
import foo from 'src/foo';
// 4. modules from a "parent" directory
import foo from '../foo';
import qux from '../../foo/qux';
// 5. "sibling" modules from the same or a sibling's directory
import bar from './bar';
import baz from './bar/baz';
// 6. "index" of the current directory
import main from './';
// 7. "object"-imports (only available in TypeScript)
import log = console.log;
// 8. "type" imports (only available in Flow and TypeScript)
import type { Foo } from 'foo';
```

See [here][3] for further details on how imports are grouped.

## Fail

```ts
import _ from 'lodash';
import path from 'path'; // `path` import should occur before import of `lodash`

// -----

var _ = require('lodash');
var path = require('path'); // `path` import should occur before import of `lodash`

// -----

var path = require('path');
import foo from './foo'; // `import` statements must be before `require` statement
```

## Pass

```ts
import path from 'path';
import _ from 'lodash';

// -----

var path = require('path');
var _ = require('lodash');

// -----

// Allowed as ̀`babel-register` is not assigned.
require('babel-register');
var path = require('path');

// -----

// Allowed as `import` must be before `require`
import foo from './foo';
var path = require('path');
```

## Limitations of `--fix`

Unbound imports are assumed to have side effects, and will never be moved/reordered. This can cause other imports to get "stuck" around them, and the fix to fail.

```javascript
import b from 'b'
import 'format.css';  // This will prevent --fix from working.
import a from 'a'
```

As a workaround, move unbound imports to be entirely above or below bound ones.

```javascript
import 'format1.css';  // OK
import b from 'b'
import a from 'a'
import 'format2.css';  // OK
```

## Options

This rule supports the following options (none of which are required):

 - [`groups`][18]
 - [`pathGroups`][8]
 - [`pathGroupsExcludedImportTypes`][9]
 - [`distinctGroup`][32]
 - [`newlines-between`][20]
 - [`alphabetize`][30]
 - [`named`][33]
 - [`warnOnUnassignedImports`][5]
 - [`sortTypesGroup`][7]
 - [`newlines-between-types`][27]
 - [`consolidateIslands`][25]

### `groups`

Valid values: `("builtin" | "external" | "internal" | "unknown" | "parent" | "sibling" | "index" | "object" | "type")[]` \
Default: `["builtin", "external", "parent", "sibling", "index"]`

Determines which imports are subject to ordering, and how to order
them. The predefined groups are: `"builtin"`, `"external"`, `"internal"`,
`"unknown"`, `"parent"`, `"sibling"`, `"index"`, `"object"`, and `"type"`.

The import order enforced by this rule is the same as the order of each group
in `groups`. Imports belonging to groups omitted from `groups` are lumped
together at the end.

#### Example

```jsonc
{
  "import/order": ["error", {
    "groups": [
      // Imports of builtins are first
      "builtin",
      // Then sibling and parent imports. They can be mingled together
      ["sibling", "parent"],
      // Then index file imports
      "index",
      // Then any arcane TypeScript imports
      "object",
      // Then the omitted imports: internal, external, type, unknown
    ],
  }],
}
```

#### How Imports Are Grouped

An import (a `ImportDeclaration`, `TSImportEqualsDeclaration`, or `require()` `CallExpression`) is grouped by its type (`"require"` vs `"import"`), its [specifier][4], and any corresponding identifiers.

```ts
import { identifier1, identifier2 } from 'specifier1';
import type { MyType } from 'specifier2';
const identifier3 = require('specifier3');
```

Roughly speaking, the grouping algorithm is as follows:

1. If the import has no corresponding identifiers (e.g. `import './my/thing.js'`), is otherwise "unassigned," or is an unsupported use of `require()`, and [`warnOnUnassignedImports`][5] is disabled, it will be ignored entirely since the order of these imports may be important for their [side-effects][31]
2. If the import is part of an arcane TypeScript declaration (e.g. `import log = console.log`), it will be considered **object**. However, note that external module references (e.g. `import x = require('z')`) are treated as normal `require()`s and import-exports (e.g. `export import w = y;`) are ignored entirely
3. If the import is [type-only][6], `"type"` is in `groups`, and [`sortTypesGroup`][7] is disabled, it will be considered **type** (with additional implications if using [`pathGroups`][8] and `"type"` is in [`pathGroupsExcludedImportTypes`][9])
4. If the import's specifier matches [`import/internal-regex`][28], it will be considered **internal**
5. If the import's specifier is an absolute path, it will be considered **unknown**
6. If the import's specifier has the name of a Node.js core module (using [is-core-module][10]), it will be considered **builtin**
7. If the import's specifier matches [`import/core-modules`][11], it will be considered **builtin**
8. If the import's specifier is a path relative to the parent directory of its containing file (e.g. starts with `../`), it will be considered **parent**
9. If the import's specifier is one of `['.', './', './index', './index.js']`, it will be considered **index**
10. If the import's specifier is a path relative to its containing file (e.g. starts with `./`), it will be considered **sibling**
11. If the import's specifier is a path pointing to a file outside the current package's root directory (determined using [package-up][12]), it will be considered **external**
12. If the import's specifier matches [`import/external-module-folders`][29] (defaults to matching anything pointing to files within the current package's `node_modules` directory), it will be considered **external**
13. If the import's specifier is a path pointing to a file within the current package's root directory (determined using [package-up][12]), it will be considered **internal**
14. If the import's specifier has a name that looks like a scoped package (e.g. `@scoped/package-name`), it will be considered **external**
15. If the import's specifier has a name that starts with a word character, it will be considered **external**
16. If this point is reached, the import will be ignored entirely

At the end of the process, if they co-exist in the same file, all top-level `require()` statements that haven't been ignored are shifted (with respect to their order) below any ES6 `import` or similar declarations. Finally, any type-only declarations are potentially reorganized according to [`sortTypesGroup`][7].

### `pathGroups`

Valid values: `PathGroup[]` \
Default: `[]`

Sometimes [the predefined groups][18] are not fine-grained enough, especially when using import aliases.
`pathGroups` defines one or more [`PathGroup`][13]s relative to a predefined group.
Imports are associated with a [`PathGroup`][13] based on path matching against the import specifier (using [minimatch][14]).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Note that, by default, imports grouped as `"builtin"`, `"external"`, or `"object"` will not be considered for further `pathGroups` matching unless they are removed from [`pathGroupsExcludedImportTypes`][9].

        // Minimatch pattern used to match against specifiers
        "pattern": "~/**",
        // The predefined group this PathGroup is defined in relation to
        "group": "external",
        // How matching imports will be positioned relative to "group"
        "position": "after"
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### `pathGroupsExcludedImportTypes`

Valid values: `("builtin" | "external" | "internal" | "unknown" | "parent" | "sibling" | "index" | "object" | "type")[]` \
Default: `["builtin", "external", "object"]`

By default, imports in certain [groups][18] are excluded from being matched against [`pathGroups`][8] to prevent overeager sorting.
Use `pathGroupsExcludedImportTypes` to modify which groups are excluded.

> [!TIP]
>
> If using imports with custom specifier aliases (e.g.
> you're using `eslint-import-resolver-alias`, `paths` in `tsconfig.json`, etc) that [end up
> grouped][3] as `"builtin"` or `"external"` imports,
> remove them from  `pathGroupsExcludedImportTypes` to ensure they are ordered
> correctly.

#### Example

```jsonc
{
  "import/order": ["error", {
    "pathGroups": [
      {
        "pattern": "@app/**",
        "group": "external",
        "position": "after"
      }
    ],
    "pathGroupsExcludedImportTypes": ["builtin"]
  }]
}
```

### `distinctGroup`

Valid values: `boolean` \
Default: `true`

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Currently, `distinctGroup` defaults to `true`. However, in a later update, the
> default will change to `false`.

This changes how [`PathGroup.position`][13] affects grouping, and is most useful when [`newlines-between`][20] is set to `always` and at least one [`PathGroup`][13] has a `position` property set.

When [`newlines-between`][20] is set to `always` and an import matching a specific [`PathGroup.pattern`][13] is encountered, that import is added to a sort of "sub-group" associated with that [`PathGroup`][13]. Thanks to [`newlines-between`][20], imports in this "sub-group" will have a new line separating them from the rest of the imports in [`PathGroup.group`][13].

This behavior can be undesirable when using [`PathGroup.position`][13] to order imports _within_ [`PathGroup.group`][13] instead of creating a distinct "sub-group". Set `distinctGroup` to `false` to disable the creation of these "sub-groups".

#### Example

```jsonc
{
  "import/order": ["error", {
    "distinctGroup": false,
    "newlines-between": "always",
    "pathGroups": [
      {
        "pattern": "@app/**",
        "group": "external",
        "position": "after"
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### `newlines-between`

Valid values: `"ignore" | "always" | "always-and-inside-groups" | "never"` \
Default: `"ignore"`

Enforces or forbids new lines between import groups.

 - If set to `ignore`, no errors related to new lines between import groups will be reported

 - If set to `always`, at least one new line between each group will be enforced, and new lines inside a group will be forbidden

  > [!TIP]
  >
  > To prevent multiple lines between imports, the [`no-multiple-empty-lines` rule][21], or a tool like [Prettier][22], can be used.

 - If set to `always-and-inside-groups`, it will act like `always` except new lines are allowed inside import groups

 - If set to `never`, no new lines are allowed in the entire import section

#### Example

With the default [`groups`][18] setting, the following will fail the rule check:

```ts
/* eslint import/order: ["error", {"newlines-between": "always"}] */
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import sibling from './foo';
import index from './';
```

```ts
/* eslint import/order: ["error", {"newlines-between": "always-and-inside-groups"}] */
import fs from 'fs';

import path from 'path';
import sibling from './foo';
import index from './';
```

```ts
/* eslint import/order: ["error", {"newlines-between": "never"}] */
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

import sibling from './foo';

import index from './';
```

While this will pass:

```ts
/* eslint import/order: ["error", {"newlines-between": "always"}] */
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

import sibling from './foo';

import index from './';
```

```ts
/* eslint import/order: ["error", {"newlines-between": "always-and-inside-groups"}] */
import fs from 'fs';

import path from 'path';

import sibling from './foo';

import index from './';
```

```ts
/* eslint import/order: ["error", {"newlines-between": "never"}] */
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import sibling from './foo';
import index from './';
```

### `alphabetize`

Valid values: `{ order?: "asc" | "desc" | "ignore", orderImportKind?: "asc" | "desc" | "ignore", caseInsensitive?: boolean }` \
Default: `{ order: "ignore", orderImportKind: "ignore", caseInsensitive: false }`

Determine the sort order of imports within each [predefined group][18] or [`PathGroup`][8] alphabetically based on specifier.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Imports will be alphabetized based on their _specifiers_, not by their
> identifiers. For example, `const a = require('z');` will come _after_ `const z = require('a');` when `alphabetize` is set to `{ order: "asc" }`.

Valid properties and their values include:

 - **`order`**: use `"asc"` to sort in ascending order, `"desc"` to sort in descending order, or "ignore" to prevent sorting

 - **`orderImportKind`**: use `"asc"` to sort various _import kinds_, e.g. [type-only and typeof imports][6], in ascending order, `"desc"` to sort them in descending order, or "ignore" to prevent sorting

 - **`caseInsensitive`**: use `true` to ignore case and `false` to consider case when sorting

#### Example

Given the following settings:

```jsonc
{
  "import/order": ["error", {
    "alphabetize": {
      "order": "asc",
      "caseInsensitive": true
    }
  }]
}
```

This will fail the rule check:

```ts
import React, { PureComponent } from 'react';
import aTypes from 'prop-types';
import { compose, apply } from 'xcompose';
import * as classnames from 'classnames';
import blist from 'BList';
```

While this will pass:

```ts
import blist from 'BList';
import * as classnames from 'classnames';
import aTypes from 'prop-types';
import React, { PureComponent } from 'react';
import { compose, apply } from 'xcompose';
```

### `named`

Valid values: `boolean | { enabled: boolean, import?: boolean, export?: boolean, require?: boolean, cjsExports?: boolean, types?: "mixed" | "types-first" | "types-last" }` \
Default: `false`

Enforce ordering of names within imports and exports.

If set to `true` or `{ enabled: true }`, _all_ named imports must be ordered according to [`alphabetize`][30].
If set to `false` or `{ enabled: false }`, named imports can occur in any order.

If set to `{ enabled: true, ... }`, and any of the properties `import`, `export`, `require`, or `cjsExports` are set to `false`, named ordering is disabled with respect to the following kind of expressions:

 - `import`:

  ```ts
  import { Readline } from "readline";
  ```

 - `export`:

  ```ts
  export { Readline };
  // and
  export { Readline } from "readline";
  ```

 - `require`:

  ```ts
  const { Readline } = require("readline");
  ```

 - `cjsExports`:

  ```ts
  module.exports.Readline = Readline;
  // and
  module.exports = { Readline };
  ```

Further, the `named.types` option allows you to specify the order of [import identifiers with inline type qualifiers][23] (or "type-only" identifiers/names), e.g. `import { type TypeIdentifier1, normalIdentifier2 } from 'specifier';`.

`named.types` accepts the following values:

 - `types-first`: forces type-only identifiers to occur first
 - `types-last`: forces type-only identifiers to occur last
 - `mixed`: sorts all identifiers in alphabetical order

#### Example

Given the following settings:

```jsonc
{
  "import/order": ["error", {
    "named": true,
    "alphabetize": {
      "order": "asc"
    }
  }]
}
```

This will fail the rule check:

```ts
import { compose, apply } from 'xcompose';
```

While this will pass:

```ts
import { apply, compose } from 'xcompose';
```

### `warnOnUnassignedImports`

Valid values: `boolean` \
Default: `false`

Warn when "unassigned" imports are out of order.
Unassigned imports are imports with no corresponding identifiers (e.g. `import './my/thing.js'` or `require('./side-effects.js')`).

> [!NOTE]
>
> These warnings are not fixable with `--fix` since unassigned imports might be used for their [side-effects][31],
> and changing the order of such imports cannot be done safely.

#### Example

Given the following settings:

```jsonc
{
  "import/order": ["error", {
    "warnOnUnassignedImports": true
  }]
}
```

This will fail the rule check:

```ts
import fs from 'fs';
import './styles.css';
import path from 'path';
```

While this will pass:

```ts
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import './styles.css';
```

### `sortTypesGroup`

Valid values: `boolean` \
Default: `false`

> [!NOTE]
>
> This setting is only meaningful when `"type"` is included in [`groups`][18].

Sort [type-only imports][6] separately from normal non-type imports.

When enabled, the intragroup sort order of [type-only imports][6] will mirror the intergroup ordering of normal imports as defined by [`groups`][18], [`pathGroups`][8], etc.

#### Example

Given the following settings:

```jsonc
{
  "import/order": ["error", {
    "groups": ["type", "builtin", "parent", "sibling", "index"],
    "alphabetize": { "order": "asc" }
  }]
}
```

This will fail the rule check even though it's logically ordered as we expect (builtins come before parents, parents come before siblings, siblings come before indices), the only difference is we separated type-only imports from normal imports:

```ts
import type A from "fs";
import type B from "path";
import type C from "../foo.js";
import type D from "./bar.js";
import type E from './';

import a from "fs";
import b from "path";
import c from "../foo.js";
import d from "./bar.js";
import e from "./";
```

This happens because [type-only imports][6] are considered part of one global
[`"type"` group](#how-imports-are-grouped) by default. However, if we set
`sortTypesGroup` to `true`:

```jsonc
{
  "import/order": ["error", {
    "groups": ["type", "builtin", "parent", "sibling", "index"],
    "alphabetize": { "order": "asc" },
    "sortTypesGroup": true
  }]
}
```

The same example will pass.

### `newlines-between-types`

Valid values: `"ignore" | "always" | "always-and-inside-groups" | "never"` \
Default: the value of [`newlines-between`][20]

> [!NOTE]
>
> This setting is only meaningful when [`sortTypesGroup`][7] is enabled.

`newlines-between-types` is functionally identical to [`newlines-between`][20] except it only enforces or forbids new lines between _[type-only][6] import groups_, which exist only when [`sortTypesGroup`][7] is enabled.

In addition, when determining if a new line is enforceable or forbidden between the type-only imports and the normal imports, `newlines-between-types` takes precedence over [`newlines-between`][20].

#### Example

Given the following settings:

```jsonc
{
  "import/order": ["error", {
    "groups": ["type", "builtin", "parent", "sibling", "index"],
    "sortTypesGroup": true,
    "newlines-between": "always"
  }]
}
```

This will fail the rule check:

```ts
import type A from "fs";
import type B from "path";
import type C from "../foo.js";
import type D from "./bar.js";
import type E from './';

import a from "fs";
import b from "path";

import c from "../foo.js";

import d from "./bar.js";

import e from "./";
```

However, if we set `newlines-between-types` to `"ignore"`:

```jsonc
{
  "import/order": ["error", {
    "groups": ["type", "builtin", "parent", "sibling", "index"],
    "sortTypesGroup": true,
    "newlines-between": "always",
    "newlines-between-types": "ignore"
  }]
}
```

The same example will pass.

Note the new line after `import type E from './';` but before `import a from "fs";`. This new line separates the type-only imports from the normal imports. Its existence is governed by [`newlines-between-types`][27] and _not `newlines-between`_.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> In certain situations, [`consolidateIslands: true`][25] will take precedence over `newlines-between-types: "never"`, if used, when it comes to the new line separating type-only imports from normal imports.

The next example will pass even though there's a new line preceding the normal import and [`newlines-between`][20] is set to `"never"`:

```jsonc
{
  "import/order": ["error", {
    "groups": ["type", "builtin", "parent", "sibling", "index"],
    "sortTypesGroup": true,
    "newlines-between": "never",
    "newlines-between-types": "always"
  }]
}
```

```ts
import type A from "fs";

import type B from "path";

import type C from "../foo.js";

import type D from "./bar.js";

import type E from './';

import a from "fs";
import b from "path";
import c from "../foo.js";
import d from "./bar.js";
import e from "./";
```

While the following fails due to the new line between the last type import and the first normal import:

```jsonc
{
  "import/order": ["error", {
    "groups": ["type", "builtin", "parent", "sibling", "index"],
    "sortTypesGroup": true,
    "newlines-between": "always",
    "newlines-between-types": "never"
  }]
}
```

```ts
import type A from "fs";
import type B from "path";
import type C from "../foo.js";
import type D from "./bar.js";
import type E from './';

import a from "fs";

import b from "path";

import c from "../foo.js";

import d from "./bar.js";

import e from "./";
```

### `consolidateIslands`

Valid values: `"inside-groups" | "never"` \
Default: `"never"`

> [!NOTE]
>
> This setting is only meaningful when [`newlines-between`][20] and/or [`newlines-between-types`][27] is set to `"always-and-inside-groups"`.

When set to `"inside-groups"`, this ensures imports spanning multiple lines are separated from other imports with a new line while single-line imports are grouped together (and the space between them consolidated) if they belong to the same [group][18] or [`pathGroups`][8].

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> When all of the following are true:
>
>  - [`sortTypesGroup`][7] is set to `true`
>  - `consolidateIslands` is set to `"inside-groups"`
>  - [`newlines-between`][20] is set to `"always-and-inside-groups"` when [`newlines-between-types`][27] is set to `"never"` (or vice-versa)
>
> Then [`newlines-between`][20]/[`newlines-between-types`][27] will yield to
> `consolidateIslands` and allow new lines to separate multi-line imports
> regardless of the `"never"` setting.
>
> This configuration is useful, for instance, to keep single-line type-only
> imports stacked tightly together at the bottom of your import block to
> preserve space while still logically organizing normal imports for quick and
> pleasant reference.

#### Example

Given the following settings:

```jsonc
{
  "import/order": ["error", {
    "newlines-between": "always-and-inside-groups",
    "consolidateIslands": "inside-groups"
  }]
}
```

This will fail the rule check:

```ts
var fs = require('fs');
var path = require('path');
var { util1, util2, util3 } = require('util');
var async = require('async');
var relParent1 = require('../foo');
var {
  relParent21,
  relParent22,
  relParent23,
  relParent24,
} = require('../');
var relParent3 = require('../bar');
var { sibling1,
  sibling2, sibling3 } = require('./foo');
var sibling2 = require('./bar');
var sibling3 = require('./foobar');
```

While this will succeed (and is what `--fix` would yield):

```ts
var fs = require('fs');
var path = require('path');
var { util1, util2, util3 } = require('util');

var async = require('async');

var relParent1 = require('../foo');

var {
  relParent21,
  relParent22,
  relParent23,
  relParent24,
} = require('../');

var relParent3 = require('../bar');

var { sibling1,
  sibling2, sibling3 } = require('./foo');

var sibling2 = require('./bar');
var sibling3 = require('./foobar');
```

Note the intragroup "islands" of grouped single-line imports, as well as multi-line imports, are surrounded by new lines. At the same time, note the typical new lines separating different groups are still maintained thanks to [`newlines-between`][20].

The same holds true for the next example; when given the following settings:

```jsonc
{
  "import/order": ["error", {
    "alphabetize": { "order": "asc" },
    "groups": ["external", "internal", "index", "type"],
    "pathGroups": [
      {
        "pattern": "dirA/**",
        "group": "internal",
        "position": "after"
      },
      {
        "pattern": "dirB/**",
        "group": "internal",
        "position": "before"
      },
      {
        "pattern": "dirC/**",
        "group": "internal"
      }
    ],
    "newlines-between": "always-and-inside-groups",
    "newlines-between-types": "never",
    "pathGroupsExcludedImportTypes": [],
    "sortTypesGroup": true,
    "consolidateIslands": "inside-groups"
  }]
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Pay special attention to the value of [`pathGroupsExcludedImportTypes`][9]** in this example's settings.
> Without it, the successful example below would fail.
> This is because the imports with specifiers starting with "dirA/", "dirB/", and "dirC/" are all [considered part of the `"external"` group](#how-imports-are-grouped), and imports in that group are excluded from [`pathGroups`][8] matching by default.
>
> The fix is to remove `"external"` (and, in this example, the others) from [`pathGroupsExcludedImportTypes`][9].

import d from 'bar';
import {

} from 'baz';

import type { E1 } from 'dirA/baz';
import type { F } from './index.js';

```

While this will succeed (and is what `--fix` would yield):

```ts

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/docs/rules/prefer-default-export.md`
```markdown
# import/prefer-default-export

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

In exporting files, this rule checks if there is default export or not.

## Rule Details

### rule schema

```javascript
"import/prefer-default-export": [
    ( "off" | "warn" | "error" ),
    { "target": "single" | "any" } // default is "single"
]
```

### Config Options

There are two options available: `single` and `any`. By default, if you do not specify the option, rule will assume it is `single`.

#### single

**Definition**: When there is only a single export from a module, prefer using default export over named export.

How to setup config file for this rule:

```javascript
// you can manually specify it
"rules": {
    "import/prefer-default-export": [
        ( "off" | "warn" | "error" ),
        { "target": "single" }
    ]
}

// config setup below will also work
"rules": {
    "import/prefer-default-export": "off" | "warn" | "error"
}
```

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```javascript
// bad.js

// There is only a single module export and it's a named export.
export const foo = 'foo';

```

The following patterns are not warnings:

```javascript
// good1.js

// There is a default export.
export const foo = 'foo';
const bar = 'bar';
export default bar;
```

```javascript
// good2.js

// There is more than one named export in the module.
export const foo = 'foo';
export const bar = 'bar';
```

```javascript
// good3.js

// There is more than one named export in the module
const foo = 'foo';
const bar = 'bar';
export { foo, bar }
```

```javascript
// good4.js

// There is a default export.
const foo = 'foo';
export { foo as default }
```

```javascript
// export-star.js

// Any batch export will disable this rule. The remote module is not inspected.
export * from './other-module'
```

#### any

**Definition**: any exporting file must contain a default export.

How to setup config file for this rule:

```javascript
// you have to manually specify it
"rules": {
    "import/prefer-default-export": [
        ( "off" | "warn" | "error" ),
        { "target": "any" }
    ]
}
```

The following patterns are *not* considered warnings:

```javascript
// good1.js

//has default export
export default function bar() {};
```

```javascript
// good2.js

// has default export
let foo;
export { foo as default }
```

```javascript
// good3.js

//contains multiple exports AND default export
export const a = 5;
export function bar(){};
let foo;
export { foo as default }
```

```javascript
// good4.js

// does not contain any exports => file is not checked by the rule
import * as foo from './foo';﻿
```

```javascript
// export-star.js

// Any batch export will disable this rule. The remote module is not inspected.
export * from './other-module'
```

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```javascript
// bad1.js

//has 2 named exports, but no default export
export const foo = 'foo';
export const bar = 'bar';
```

```javascript
// bad2.js

// does not have default export
let foo, bar;
export { foo, bar }
```

```javascript
// bad3.js

// does not have default export
export { a, b } from "foo.js"﻿
```

```javascript
// bad4.js

// does not have default export
let item;
export const foo = item;
export { item };
```

```

```markdown
# import/unambiguous

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Warn if a `module` could be mistakenly parsed as a `script` by a consumer leveraging
[Unambiguous JavaScript Grammar] to determine correct parsing goal.

Will respect the [`parserOptions.sourceType`] from ESLint config, i.e. files parsed
as `script` per that setting will not be reported.

This plugin uses [Unambiguous JavaScript Grammar] internally to decide whether
dependencies should be parsed as modules and searched for exports matching the
`import`ed names, so it may be beneficial to keep this rule on even if your application
will run in an explicit `module`-only environment.

## Rule Details

For files parsed as `module` by ESLint, the following are valid:

```js
import 'foo'
function x() { return 42 }
```

```js
export function x() { return 42 }
```

```js
(function x() { return 42 })()
export {} // simple way to mark side-effects-only file as 'module' without any imports/exports
```

...whereas the following file would be reported:

```js
(function x() { return 42 })()
```

## When Not To Use It

If your application environment will always know via [some other means](https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps/issues/13)
how to parse, regardless of syntax, you may not need this rule.

Remember, though, that this plugin uses this strategy internally, so if you were
to `import` from a module with no `import`s or `export`s, this plugin would not
report it as it would not be clear whether it should be considered a `script` or
a `module`.

❌ This rule is deprecated.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Emoji have become a common way of communicating content to the end user. To a person using a screen reader, however, they may not be aware that this content is there at all. By wrapping the emoji in a `<span>`, giving it the `role="img"`, and providing a useful description in `aria-label`, the screen reader will treat the emoji as an image in the accessibility tree with an accessible name for the end user.

## Rule details

This rule takes no arguments.

### Succeed
```jsx
<span role="img" aria-label="Snowman">&#9731;</span>
<span role="img" aria-label="Panda">🐼</span>
<span role="img" aria-labelledby="panda1">🐼</span>

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/docs/rules/alt-text.md`
```markdown
# jsx-a11y/alt-text

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Enforce that all elements that require alternative text have meaningful information to relay back to the end user. This is a critical component of accessibility for screen reader users in order for them to understand the content's purpose on the page. By default, this rule checks for alternative text on the following elements: `<img>`, `<area>`, `<input type="image">`, and `<object>`.

## How to resolve

### `<img>`

An `<img>` must have the `alt` prop set with meaningful text or as an empty string to indicate that it is an image for decoration.

For images that are being used as icons for a button or control, the `alt` prop should be set to an empty string (`alt=""`).

```jsx
<button>
  <img src="icon.png" alt="" />
  Save

</button>
```

The content of an `alt` attribute is used to calculate the accessible label of an element, whereas the text content is used to produce a label for the element. For this reason, adding a label to an icon can produce a confusing or duplicated label on a control that already has appropriate text content.

### `<object>`

Add alternative text to all embedded `<object>` elements using either inner text, setting the `title` prop, or using the `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` props.

### `<input type="image">`

All `<input type="image">` elements must have a non-empty `alt` prop set with a meaningful description of the image or have the `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` props set.

### `<area>`

All clickable `<area>` elements within an image map have an `alt`, `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` prop that describes the purpose of the link.

## Rule options

This rule takes one optional object argument of type object:

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "jsx-a11y/alt-text": [ 2, {
            "elements": [ "img", "object", "area", "input[type=\"image\"]" ],
            "img": ["Image"],
            "object": ["Object"],
            "area": ["Area"],
            "input[type=\"image\"]": ["InputImage"]
          }],
    }
}
```

The `elements` option is a whitelist for DOM elements to check for alternative text. If an element is removed from the default set of elements (noted above), any custom components for that component will also be ignored. In order to indicate any custom wrapper components that should be checked, you can map the DOM element to an array of JSX custom components. This is a good use case when you have a wrapper component that simply renders an `img` element, for instance (like in React):

```jsx
// Image.js
const Image = props => {
  const {
    alt,
    ...otherProps
  } = props;

  return (
    <img alt={alt} {...otherProps} />
  );
}

...

// Header.js (for example)
...
return (
  <header>
    <Image alt="Logo" src="logo.jpg" />
  </header>

);
```

Note that passing props as spread attribute without explicitly the necessary accessibility props defined will cause this rule to fail. Explicitly pass down the set of props needed for rule to pass. Use `Image` component above as a reference for destructuring and applying the prop. **It is a good thing to explicitly pass props that you expect to be passed for self-documentation.** For example:

#### Bad

```jsx
function Foo(props) {
  return <img {...props} />
}
```

#### Good

```jsx
function Foo({ alt, ...props}) {
    return <img alt={alt} {...props} />
}

// OR

function Foo(props) {
    const {
        alt,

        ...otherProps
    } = props;

   return <img alt={alt} {...otherProps} />
}
```

### Succeed

```jsx
<img src="foo" alt="Foo eating a sandwich." />
<img src="foo" alt={"Foo eating a sandwich."} />
<img src="foo" alt={altText} />
<img src="foo" alt={`${person} smiling`} />
<img src="foo" alt="" />

<object aria-label="foo" />
<object aria-labelledby="id1" />
<object>Meaningful description</object>
<object title="An object" />

<area aria-label="foo" />
<area aria-labelledby="id1" />

<area alt="This is descriptive!" />

<input type="image" alt="This is descriptive!" />
<input type="image" aria-label="foo" />
<input type="image" aria-labelledby="id1" />

```

### Fail

```jsx
<img src="foo" />
<img {...props} />
<img {...props} alt /> // Has no value
<img {...props} alt={undefined} /> // Has no value
<img {...props} alt={`${undefined}`} /> // Has no value
<img src="foo" role="presentation" /> // Avoid ARIA if it can be achieved without

<img src="foo" role="none" /> // Avoid ARIA if it can be achieved without

<object {...props} />


<area {...props} />

<input type="image" {...props} />
```

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/docs/rules/anchor-ambiguous-text.md`
```markdown
# jsx-a11y/anchor-ambiguous-text

🚫 This rule is _disabled_ in the ☑️ `recommended` config.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Enforces `<a>` values are not exact matches for the phrases "click here", "here", "link", "a link", or "learn more". Screen readers announce tags as links/interactive, but rely on values for context. Ambiguous anchor descriptions do not provide sufficient context for users.

## Rule options

This rule takes one optional object argument with the parameter `words`.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "jsx-a11y/anchor-ambiguous-text": [2, {
      "words": ["click this"],
    }],
  }
}
```

The `words` option allows users to modify the strings that can be checked for in the anchor text. Useful for specifying other words in other languages. The default value is set by `DEFAULT_AMBIGUOUS_WORDS`:

```js
const DEFAULT_AMBIGUOUS_WORDS = ['click here', 'here', 'link', 'a link', 'learn more'];
```

The logic to calculate the inner text of an anchor is as follows:

- if an element has the `aria-label` property, its value is used instead of the inner text
- if an element has `aria-hidden="true`, it is skipped over
- if an element is `<img />` or configured to be interpreted like one, its `alt` value is used as its inner text

Note that this rule still disallows ambiguous `aria-label` or `alt` values.

Note that this rule is case-insensitive, trims whitespace, and ignores certain punctuation (`[,.?¿!‽¡;:]`). It only looks for **exact matches**.

### Succeed

```jsx
<a>read this tutorial</a> // passes since it is not one of the disallowed words
<a>${here}</a> // this is valid since 'here' is a variable name
<a aria-label="tutorial on using eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y">click here</a> // the aria-label supersedes the inner text
```

### Fail

```jsx
<a>here</a>
<a>HERE</a>
<a>link</a>
<a>click here</a>
<a>learn more</a>
<a>learn more.</a>
<a>learn more,</a>
<a>learn more?</a>
<a>learn more!</a>
<a>learn more:</a>
<a>learn more;</a>
<a>a link</a>
<a> a link </a>
<a><span> click </span> here</a> // goes through element children
<a>a<i></i> link</a>
<a><i></i>a link</a>
<a><span aria-hidden="true">more text</span>learn more</a> // skips over elements with aria-hidden=true
<a aria-label="click here">something</a> // the aria-label here is inaccessible
<a><img alt="click here"/></a> // the alt tag is still ambiguous
<a alt="tutorial on using eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y">click here</a> // the alt tag is only parsed on img
```

## Accessibility guidelines

Ensure anchor tags describe the content of the link, opposed to simply describing them as a link.

Compare

```jsx
<p><a href="#">click here</a> to read a tutorial by Foo Bar</p>
```

which can be more concise and accessible with

```jsx
<p>read <a href="#">a tutorial by Foo Bar</a></p>
```

```markdown
# jsx-a11y/anchor-has-content

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Enforce that anchors have content and that the content is accessible to screen readers. Accessible means that it is not hidden using the `aria-hidden` prop. Refer to the references to learn about why this is important.

Alternatively, you may use the `title` prop or the `aria-label` prop.

## Rule options

This rule takes one optional object argument of type object:

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "jsx-a11y/anchor-has-content": [ 2, {
            "components": [ "Anchor" ],
          }],
    }
}
```

For the `components` option, these strings determine which JSX elements (**always including** `<a>`) should be checked for having content. This is a good use case when you have a wrapper component that simply renders an `a` element (like in React):

```js
// Anchor.js
const Anchor = props => {
  return (
    <a {...props}>{ props.children }</a>
  );
}

```markdown
# jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

The HTML `<a>` element, with a valid `href` attribute, is formally defined as representing a **hyperlink**. That is, a link between one HTML document and another, or between one location inside an HTML document and another location inside the same document.

In fact, the interactive, underlined `<a>` element has become so synonymous with web navigation that this expectation has become entrenched inside browsers, assistive technologies such as screen readers and in how people generally expect the internet to behave. In short, anchors should navigate.

The use of JavaScript frameworks and libraries, like _React_, has made it very easy to add or subtract functionality from the standard HTML elements. This has led to _anchors_ often being used in applications based on how they look and function instead of what they represent.

Whilst it is possible, for example, to turn the `<a>` element into a fully functional `<button>` element with ARIA, the native user agent implementations of HTML elements are to be preferred over custom ARIA solutions.

## How do I resolve this error?

### Case: I want to perform an action and need a clickable UI element

The native user agent implementations of the `<a>` and `<button>` elements not only differ in how they look and how they act when activated, but also in how the user is expected to interact with them. Both are perfectly clickable when using a mouse, but keyboard users expect `<a>` to activate on `enter` only and `<button>` to activate on _both_ `enter` and `space`.

This is exacerbated by the expectation sighted users have of how _buttons_ and _anchors_ work based on their appearance. Therefore we find that using _anchors_ as _buttons_ can easily create confusion without a relatively complicated ARIA and CSS implementation that only serves to create an element HTML already offers and browsers already implement fully accessibly.

We are aware that sometimes _anchors_ are used instead of _buttons_ to achieve a specific visual design. When using the `<button>` element this can still be achieved with styling but, due to the meaning many people attach to the standard underlined `<a>` due its appearance, please reconsider this in the design.

Consider the following:

```jsx
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick={foo}>Perform action</a>
<a href="#" onClick={foo}>Perform action</a>
<a onClick={foo}>Perform action</a>
```

All these _anchor_ implementations indicate that the element is only used to execute JavaScript code. All the above should be replaced with:

```jsx
<button onClick={foo}>Perform action</button>
```

### Case: I want navigable links

An `<a>` element without an `href` attribute no longer functions as a hyperlink. That means that it can no longer accept keyboard focus or be clicked on. The documentation for [no-noninteractive-tabindex](no-noninteractive-tabindex.md) explores this further. Preferably use another element (such as `div` or `span`) for display of text.

To properly function as a hyperlink, the `href` attribute should be present and also contain a valid _URL_. _JavaScript_ strings, empty values or using only **#** are not considered valid `href` values.

Valid `href` attributes values are:

```jsx
<a href="/some/valid/uri">Navigate to page</a>
<a href="/some/valid/uri#top">Navigate to page and location</a>
<a href="#top">Navigate to internal page location</a>
```

### Case: I need the HTML to be interactive, don't I need to use an a tag for that?

An `<a>` tag is not inherently interactive. Without an href attribute, it really is no different from a `<span>`.

Let's look at an example that is not accessible by all users:

```jsx
<a
  className="thing"
  onMouseEnter={() => this.setState({ showSomething: true })}
>
  {label}
</a>
```

If you need to create an interface element that the user can click on, consider using a button:

```jsx
<button
  className="thing"
  onClick={() => this.setState({ showSomething: true })}
>
  {label}
</button>
```

If you want to navigate while providing the user with extra functionality, for example in the `onMouseEnter` event, use an anchor with an `href` attribute containing a URL or path as its value.

```jsx
<a
  href={someValidPath}
  className="thing"
  onMouseEnter={() => this.setState({ showSomething: true })}
>
  {label}
</a>
```

If you need to create an interface element that the user can mouse over or mouse out of, consider using a div element. In this case, you may need to apply a role of presentation or an interactive role. Interactive ARIA roles include `button`, `link`, `checkbox`, `menuitem`, `menuitemcheckbox`, `menuitemradio`, `option`, `radio`, `searchbox`, `switch` and `textbox`.

```jsx
<div
  role="menuitem"
  className="thing"
  onClick={() => this.setState({ showSomething: true })}
  onMouseEnter={() => this.setState({ showSomething: true })}
>
  {label}
</div>
```

In the example immediately above an `onClick` event handler was added to provide the same experience mouse users enjoy to keyboard-only and touch-screen users. Never fully rely on mouse events alone to expose functionality.

### Case: I use Next.js and I'm getting this error inside of `<Link>`s

This is a [known issue](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/issues/402) with Next.js's decision to construct internal links by nesting an href-free `<a>` tag inside of a `<Link>` component. Next.js is also [aware of the issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/5533) and has an [RFC](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/8207) working towards a solution.

Until the Next.js API can be updated to a more performant and standard setup, you have a few workaround options:

1. If you have only a few `Link`s, or they're clustered in just a few files like `nav.tsx`, you can use disable macros like `{/* eslint-disable-next-line jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid */}` to turn off validation of this rule for those usages.

2. You can use the `Link` component's `passHref` prop to override a dummy `href` on the `<a>`:
```typescript
<Link href="/my-amazing-page" passHref>
  <a href="replace">Go to my amazing page</a>
</Link>
```

3. You can invest in a custom component that wraps the creation of the `Link` and `a`. You can then add your new custom component to the list of components to validate to ensure that your links are all created with a navigable href. A sample custom component is shared [here](https://gist.github.com/zackdotcomputer/d7af9901e7db87364aad7fbfadb5c99b) and it would be used like this:
```typescript
// Internally, LinkTo handles the making of the Link and A, collecting the
// need for a lint workaround into a single file.
// Externally, LinkTo can be linted using this rule, ensuring it will always
// have a valid href prop.
<LinkTo href="/my-amazing-page">Go to my amazing page</LinkTo>
```

### Case: I understand the previous cases but still need an element resembling a link that is purely clickable

We recommend, without reserve, that elements resembling anchors should navigate. This will provide a superior user experience to a larger group of users out there.

However, we understand that developers are not always in total control of the visual design of web applications. In cases where it is imperative to provide an element resembling an anchor that purely acts as a click target with no navigation as result, we would like to recommend a compromise.

Again change the element to a `<button>`:

```jsx
<button
  type="button"
  className="link-button"
  onClick={() => this.setState({ showSomething: true })}
>
  Press me, I look like a link
</button>
```

Then use styling to change its appearance to that of a link:

```css
.link-button {
  background-color: transparent;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  text-decoration: underline;
  display: inline;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

This button element can now also be used inline in text.

Once again we stress that this is an inferior implementation and some users will encounter difficulty to use your website, however, it will allow a larger group of people to interact with your website than the alternative of ignoring the rule's warning.

## Rule options

This rule takes one optional object argument of type object:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid": [
      "error",
      {
        "components": ["Link"],
        "specialLink": ["hrefLeft", "hrefRight"],
        "aspects": ["noHref", "invalidHref", "preferButton"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

For the `components` option, these strings determine which JSX elements (**always including** `<a>`) should be checked for the props designated in the `specialLink` options (**always including** `href`). This is a good use case when you have a wrapper component that simply renders an `<a>` element (like in React):

```js
// Link.js
const Link = props => <a {...props}>A link</a>;

...

// NavBar.js (for example)
...
return (
  <nav>
    <Link href="/home" />

);
```

For the `aspects` option, these strings determine which sub-rules are run. This allows omission of certain error types in restrictive environments.

- `noHref`: Checks whether an anchor contains an `href` attribute.
- `invalidHref`: Checks if a given `href` value is valid.
- `preferButton`: Checks if anchors have been used as buttons.

The option can be used on its own or with the `components` and `specialLink` options.

If omitted, all sub-rule aspects will be run by default. This is the recommended configuration for all cases except where the rule becomes unusable due to well founded restrictions.

The option must contain at least one `aspect`.

# jsx-a11y/aria-activedescendant-has-tabindex

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

`aria-activedescendant` is used to manage focus within a [composite widget](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#composite).
The element with the attribute `aria-activedescendant` retains the active document
focus; it indicates which of its child elements has secondary focus by assigning
the ID of that element to the value of `aria-activedescendant`. This pattern is
used to build a widget like a search typeahead select list. The search input box
retains document focus so that the user can type in the input. If the down arrow
key is pressed and a search suggestion is highlighted, the ID of the suggestion
element will be applied as the value of `aria-activedescendant` on the input
element.

Because an element with `aria-activedescendant` must be tabbable, it must either
have an inherent `tabIndex` of zero or declare a `tabIndex` attribute.

## Rule details

# jsx-a11y/control-has-associated-label

🚫 This rule is _disabled_ in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Enforce that a control (an interactive element) has a text label.

There are two supported ways to supply a control with a text label:

- Provide text content inside the element.
- Use the `aria-label` attribute on the element, with a text value.
- Use the `aria-labelledby` attribute on the element, and point the IDREF value to an element with an accessible label.
- Alternatively, with an `img` tag, you may use the `alt` attribute to supply a text description of the image.

The rule is permissive in the sense that it will assume that expressions will eventually provide a label. So an element like this will pass.

```jsx
<button type="button">{maybeSomethingThatContainsALabel}</button>
```

## How do I resolve this error?

### Case: I have a simple button that requires a label.

Provide text content in the `button` element.

```jsx
<button type="button">Save</button>
```

### Case: I have an icon button and I don't want visible text.

Use the `aria-label` attribute and provide the text label as the value.

```jsx
<button type="button" aria-label="Save" class="icon-save" />
```

### Case: The label for my element is already located on the page and I don't want to repeat the text in my source code.

Use the `aria-labelledby` attribute and point the IDREF value to an element with an accessible label.

```jsx
<div id="js_1">Comment</div>
<textarea aria-labelledby="js_1"></textarea>
```

### Case: My label and input components are custom components, but I still want to require that they have an accessible text label.

You can configure the rule to be aware of your custom components. Refer to the Rule Details below.

```jsx
<CustomInput label="Surname" type="text" value={value} />
```

## Rule options

This rule takes one optional object argument of type object:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "jsx-a11y/control-has-associated-label": [ 2, {
      "labelAttributes": ["label"],
      "controlComponents": ["CustomComponent"],
      "ignoreElements": [

        "tree",
        "treegrid",
      ],
      "depth": 3,
    }],
  }
}
```

- `labelAttributes` is a list of attributes to check on the control component and its children for a label. Use this if you have a custom component that uses a string passed on a prop to render an HTML `label`, for example.
- `controlComponents` is a list of custom React Components names that will render down to an interactive element.
- `ignoreElements` is an array of elements that should not be considered control (interactive) elements and therefore they do not require a text label.
- `ignoreRoles` is an array of ARIA roles that should not be considered control (interactive) roles and therefore they do not require a text label.
- `depth` (default 2, max 25) is an integer that determines how deep within a `JSXElement` the rule should look for text content or an element with a label to determine if the interactive element will have an accessible label.

# jsx-a11y/heading-has-content

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Enforce that heading elements (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) have content and that the content is accessible to screen readers. Accessible means that it is not hidden using the `aria-hidden` prop. Refer to the references to learn about why this is important.

## Rule options

This rule takes one optional object argument of type object:

```json

            "components": [ "MyHeading" ],
          }],
    }
}
```

For the `components` option, these strings determine which JSX elements (**always including** `<h1>` thru `<h6>`) should be checked for having content. This is a good use case when you have a wrapper component that simply renders an `h1` element (like in React):


```js
// Header.js
const Header = props => {
  return (
    <h1 {...props}>{ props.children }</h1>
  );
}

...

// CreateAccount.js (for example)

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Enforce img alt attribute does not contain the word image, picture, or photo. Screen readers already announce `img` elements as an image. There is no need to use words such as *image*, *photo*, and/or *picture*.

## Rule options

This rule takes one optional object argument of type object:

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "jsx-a11y/img-redundant-alt": [ 2, {
            "components": [ "Image" ],
            "words": [ "Bild", "Foto" ],
          }],
    }
}
```

For the `components` option, these strings determine which JSX elements (**always including** `<img>`) should be checked for having redundant words in the `alt` prop value . This is a good use case when you have a wrapper component that simply renders an `img` element (like in React).

For the `words` option, these strings can be used to specify custom words that should be checked for in the alt prop, including `image`, `photo`, and `picture`. Useful for specifying words in other languages.

The rule will first check if `aria-hidden` is true to determine whether to enforce the rule. If the image is hidden, then rule will always succeed.

### Succeed
```jsx
<img src="foo" alt="Foo eating a sandwich." />
<img src="bar" aria-hidden alt="Picture of me taking a photo of an image" /> // Will pass because it is hidden.
<img src="baz" alt={`Baz taking a ${photo}`} /> // This is valid since photo is a variable name.

# jsx-a11y/interactive-supports-focus

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Elements with an interactive role and interaction handlers (mouse or key press) must be focusable.

## How do I resolve this error?

### Case: I got the error "Elements with the '${role}' interactive role must be tabbable". How can I fix this?

This element is a stand-alone control like a button, a link or a form element. A user should be able to reach this element by pressing the tab key on their keyboard.

Add the `tabIndex` property to your component. A value of zero indicates that this element can be tabbed to.

```jsx
<div
  role="button"
  tabIndex={0} />
```

-- or --

Replace the component with one that renders semantic html element like `<button>`, `<a href>` or `<input>` -- whichever fits your purpose.

Generally buttons, links and form elements should be reachable via tab key presses. An element that can be tabbed to is said to be in the _tab ring_.

### Case: I got the error "Elements with the '${role}' interactive role must be focusable". How can I fix this?

This element is part of a group of buttons, links, menu items, etc. Or this element is part of a composite widget. Composite widgets prescribe standard [keyboard interaction patterns](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#kbd_generalnav). Within a group of similar elements -- like a button bar -- or within a composite widget, elements that can be focused are given a tabindex of -1. This makes the element _focusable_ but not _tabbable_. Generally one item in a group should have a tabindex of zero so that a user can tab to the component. Once an element in the component has focus, your key management behaviors will control traversal within the component's pieces. As the UI author, you will need to implement the key handling behaviors such as listening for traversal key (up/down/left/right) presses and moving the page focus between the focusable elements in your widget.

```jsx
<div role="menu">
  <div role="menuitem" tabIndex="0">Open</div>
  <div role="menuitem" tabIndex="-1">Save</div>
  <div role="menuitem" tabIndex="-1">Close</div>
</div>
```

In the example above, the first item in the group can be tabbed to. The developer provides the ability to traverse to the subsequent items via the up/down/left/right arrow keys. Traversing via arrow keys is not provided by the browser or the assistive technology. See [Fundamental Keyboard Navigation Conventions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#kbd_generalnav) for information about established traversal behaviors for various UI widgets.

### Case: This element is not a button, link, menuitem, etc. It is catching bubbled events from elements that it contains

If your element is catching bubbled click or key events from descendant elements, then the proper role for this element is `presentation`.

```jsx
<div
  onClick={onClickHandler}
  role="presentation">
  <button>Save</button>
</div>
```

Marking an element with the role `presentation` indicates to assistive technology that this element should be ignored; it exists to support the web application and is not meant for humans to interact with directly.

## Rule options

This rule takes an options object with the key `tabbable`. The value is an array of interactive ARIA roles that should be considered tabbable, not just focusable. Any interactive role not included in this list will be flagged as needing to be focusable (tabindex of -1).

```js
{
  'jsx-a11y/interactive-supports-focus': [
    'error',
    {
      tabbable: [

        'switch',
        'textbox',
      ],
    },
  ]
}
```

The recommended options list interactive roles that act as form elements. Generally, elements with a role like `menuitem` are a part of a composite widget. Focus in a composite widget is controlled and moved programmatically to satisfy the prescribed [keyboard interaction pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#kbd_generalnav) for the widget.

The list of possible values includes:

```js
[
  'button',
  'checkbox',
  'columnheader',
  'combobox',
  'grid',
  'gridcell',
  'link',
  'listbox',
  'menu',
  'menubar',
  'menuitem',
  'menuitemcheckbox',
  'menuitemradio',
  'option',
  'progressbar',
  'radio',
  'radiogroup',
  'row',
  'rowheader',
  'searchbox',
  'slider',
  'spinbutton',
  'switch',
  'tab',
  'tablist',
  'textbox',
  'toolbar',
  'tree',
  'treegrid',
  'treeitem',
  'doc-backlink',
  'doc-biblioref',
  'doc-glossref',
  'doc-noteref',
]
```

### Succeed

```jsx
<!-- Good: div with onClick attribute is hidden from screen reader -->
<div aria-hidden onClick={() => void 0} />
<!-- Good: span with onClick attribute is in the tab order -->
<span onClick="doSomething();" tabIndex="0" role="button">Click me!</span>
<!-- Good: span with onClick attribute may be focused programmatically -->
<span onClick="doSomething();" tabIndex="-1" role="menuitem">Click me too!</span>
<!-- Good: anchor element with href is inherently focusable -->
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onClick="doSomething();">Click ALL the things!</a>
<!-- Good: buttons are inherently focusable -->
<button onClick="doSomething();">Click the button :)</button>
```

### Fail

```jsx
<!-- Bad: span with onClick attribute has no tabindex -->
<span onclick="submitForm();" role="button">Submit</span>
<!-- Bad: anchor element without href is not focusable -->
<a onclick="showNextPage();" role="button">Next page</a>
```

```markdown
# jsx-a11y/label-has-associated-control

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Enforce that a label tag has a text label and an associated control.

There are two supported ways to associate a label with a control:

- Wrapping a control in a label tag.
- Adding `htmlFor` to a label and assigning it a DOM ID string that indicates an input on the page.

This rule checks that any `label` tag (or an indicated custom component that will output a `label` tag) either (1) wraps an `input` element (or an indicated custom component that will output an `input` tag) or (2) has an `htmlFor` attribute and that the `label` tag has text content.

## How do I resolve this error?

### Case: I just want a text label associated with an input.

The simplest way to achieve an association between a label and an input is to wrap the input in the label.

```jsx
<label>
  Surname
  <input type="text" />
</label>
```

All modern browsers and assistive technology will associate the label with the control.

### Case: The label is a sibling of the control.

In this case, use `htmlFor` and an ID to associate the controls.

```jsx
<label htmlFor={domId}>Surname</label>
<input type="text" id={domId} />
```

### Case: My label and input components are custom components.

You can configure the rule to be aware of your custom components.

```jsx
<CustomInputLabel label="Surname">
  <CustomInput type="text" value={value} />
</CustomInputLabel>
```

And the configuration:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "jsx-a11y/label-has-associated-control": [ 2, {
      "labelComponents": ["CustomInputLabel"],
      "labelAttributes": ["label"],
      "controlComponents": ["CustomInput"],
      "depth": 3,
    }],
  }
}
```

### Case: I have two labels for the same input

If the second `label` is in a different part of the HTML, then the second one can only contain `htmlFor` but not nesting. You will probably need eslint override comment on the second label.

```jsx
{/* eslint jsx-a11y/label-has-associated-control: ["error", { assert: "either" } ] */}
<label htmlFor="a">
  Username:
</label>
...
<label htmlFor="a">
  <input id="a" />
</label>
```

## How to manage IDs of `input`

A common way to think of `id` with libraries like React is, `id`s should be avoided since it must be unique on the page, and components need to be reusable. Hence it is tempted to generate `id` during render-time if `id` is required. *However:*

IDs shouldn't be generated in the browser, so that server and client rendering are deterministic. Render-time uuids aren't just a hack, they're actually broken and should never be used.

To restate, **every ID needs to be deterministic**, on the server and the client, and guaranteed to be unique on the page. EG: For each input, a required ID prop can be passed down from as far up the tree as possible to guarantee uniqueness.

## Rule options

This rule takes one optional object argument of type object:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "jsx-a11y/label-has-associated-control": [ 2, {
      "labelComponents": ["CustomLabel"],
      "labelAttributes": ["inputLabel"],
      "controlComponents": ["CustomInput"],
      "assert": "both",
      "depth": 3,
    }],
  }
}
```

`labelComponents` is a list of custom React Component names that should be checked for an associated control.

`labelAttributes` is a list of attributes to check on the label component and its children for a label. Use this if you have a custom component that uses a string passed on a prop to render an HTML `label`, for example.

`controlComponents` is a list of custom React Components names that will output an input element. [Glob format](https://linuxhint.com/bash_globbing_tutorial/) is also supported for specifying names (e.g., `Label*` matches `LabelComponent` but not `CustomLabel`, `????Label` matches `LinkLabel` but not `CustomLabel`).

`assert` asserts that the label has htmlFor, a nested label, both or either. Available options: `'htmlFor', 'nesting', 'both', 'either'`.

`depth` (default 2, max 25) is an integer that determines how deep within a `JSXElement` label the rule should look for text content or an element with a label to determine if the `label` element will have an accessible label.

### Fail
```jsx
function Foo(props) {
  return <label {...props} />
}
```

### Succeed
```jsx
function Foo(props) {
    const {
        htmlFor,
        ...otherProps
    } = props;

   return <label htmlFor={htmlFor} {...otherProps} />
}
```

### Fail
```jsx
<input type="text" />
<label>Surname</label>
```

### Succeed
```jsx
<label>
  <input type="text" />
  Surname

```

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/docs/rules/label-has-for.md`
```markdown
# jsx-a11y/label-has-for

❌ This rule is deprecated. It was replaced by [`jsx-a11y/label-has-associated-control`](label-has-associated-control.md).

🚫 This rule is _disabled_ in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

_This rule was deprecated in v6.1.0. It will no longer be maintained._

Enforce label tags have associated control.

There are two supported ways to associate a label with a control:

- nesting: by wrapping a control in a label tag
- id: by using the prop `htmlFor` (or any configured attribute) as in `htmlFor=[ID of control]`

To fully cover 100% of assistive devices, you're encouraged to validate for both nesting and id.

## Rule options

This rule takes one optional object argument of type object:

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "jsx-a11y/label-has-for": [ 2, {
            "components": [ "Label" ],
            "required": {
                "every": [ "nesting", "id" ]
            },
            "allowChildren": false
        }]
    }
}
```

For the `components` option, these strings determine which JSX elements (**always including** `<label>`) should be checked for having `htmlFor` prop. This is a good use case when you have a wrapper component that simply renders a `label` element (like in React):

```js
// Label.js
const Label = props => {
  const {
    htmlFor,
    ...otherProps
  } = props;

  return (
    <label htmlFor={htmlFor} {...otherProps} />
  );
}

...

// CreateAccount.js (for example)
...
return (
  <form>
    <input id="firstName" type="text" />
    <Label htmlFor="firstName">First Name</Label>
  </form>
);
```

The `required` option (defaults to `"required": { "every": ["nesting", "id"] }`) determines which checks are activated. You're allowed to pass in one of the following types:

- string: must be one of the acceptable strings (`"nesting"` or `"id"`)
- object, must have one of the following properties:

  - some: an array of acceptable strings, will pass if ANY of the requested checks passed
  - every: an array of acceptable strings, will pass if ALL of the requested checks passed

The `allowChildren` option (defaults to `false`) determines whether `{children}` content is allowed to be passed into a `label` element. For example, the following pattern, by default, is not allowed:

```js
<label>{children}</label>
```

However, if `allowChildren` is set to `true`, no error will be raised. If you want to pass in `{children}` content without raising an error, because you cannot be sure what `{children}` will render, then set `allowChildren` to `true`.

Note that passing props as spread attribute without `htmlFor` explicitly defined will cause this rule to fail. Explicitly pass down `htmlFor` prop for rule to pass. The prop must have an actual value to pass. Use `Label` component above as a reference. **It is a good thing to explicitly pass props that you expect to be passed for self-documentation.** For example:

#### Bad

```jsx
function Foo(props) {
  return <label {...props} />
}
```

#### Good

```jsx
function Foo({ htmlFor, ...props}) {
    return <label htmlFor={htmlFor} {...props} />
}

// OR

function Foo(props) {
    const {
        htmlFor,
        ...otherProps
    } = props;

   return <label htmlFor={htmlFor} {...otherProps} />
}
```

### Succeed

```jsx
<label htmlFor="firstName">
  <input type="text" id="firstName" />
  First Name
</label>
```

### Fail

```jsx
<input type="text" id="firstName" />
<label>First Name</label>
```

```markdown
# jsx-a11y/media-has-caption

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Providing captions for media is essential for deaf users to follow along. Captions should be a transcription or translation of the dialogue, sound effects, relevant musical cues, and other relevant audio information. Not only is this important for accessibility, but can also be useful for all users in the case that the media is unavailable (similar to `alt` text on an image when an image is unable to load).

The captions should contain all important and relevant information to understand the corresponding media. This may mean that the captions are not a 1:1 mapping of the dialogue in the media content. However, captions are *not* necessary for video components with the `muted` attribute.

## Rule options

This rule takes one optional object argument of type object:

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "jsx-a11y/media-has-caption": [ 2, {
            "audio": [ "Audio" ],
            "video": [ "Video" ],
            "track": [ "Track" ],
          }],
    }
}
```

For the `audio`, `video`, and `track` options, these strings determine which JSX elements (**always including** their corresponding DOM element) should be used for this rule. This is a good use case when you have a wrapper component that simply renders an `audio`, `video`, or `track` element (like in React):

### Succeed
```jsx
<audio><track kind="captions" {...props} /></audio>
<video><track kind="captions" {...props} /></video>

# jsx-a11y/mouse-events-have-key-events

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Enforce onmouseover/onmouseout are accompanied by onfocus/onblur. Coding for the keyboard is important for users with physical disabilities who cannot use a mouse, AT compatibility, and screen reader users.

## Rule options

By default, this rule checks that `onmouseover` is paired with `onfocus` and that `onmouseout` is paired with `onblur`. This rule takes an optional argument to specify other handlers to check for "hover in" and/or "hover out" events:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "jsx-a11y/mouse-events-have-key-events": [
      "error",
      {
        "hoverInHandlers": [
          "onMouseOver",
          "onMouseEnter",
          "onPointerOver",
          "onPointerEnter"
        ],
        "hoverOutHandlers": [
          "onMouseOut",
          "onMouseLeave",
          "onPointerOut",
          "onPointerLeave"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Note that while `onmouseover` and `onmouseout` are checked by default if no arguments are passed in, those are *not* included by default if you *do* provide an argument, so remember to explicitly include them if you want to check them.

### Succeed
```jsx
<div onMouseOver={ () => void 0 } onFocus={ () => void 0 } />
<div onMouseOut={ () => void 0 } onBlur={ () => void 0 } />
<div onMouseOver={ () => void 0 } onFocus={ () => void 0 } {...otherProps} />
<div onMouseOut={ () => void 0 } onBlur={ () => void 0 } {...otherProps} />
```

### Fail
In example 3 and 4 below, even if otherProps contains onBlur and/or onFocus, this rule will still fail. Props should be passed down explicitly for rule to pass.

```jsx
<div onMouseOver={ () => void 0 } />
<div onMouseOut={ () => void 0 } />
<div onMouseOver={ () => void 0 } {...otherProps} />
<div onMouseOut={ () => void 0 } {...otherProps} />

Enforce that `aria-hidden="true"` is not set on focusable elements.

`aria-hidden="true"` can be used to hide purely decorative content from screen reader users. An element with `aria-hidden="true"` that can also be reached by keyboard can lead to confusion or unexpected behavior for screen reader users. Avoid using `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable elements.

## Rule details

### Succeed
```jsx
  <div aria-hidden="true" />
  <img aria-hidden="true" />
  <a aria-hidden="false" href="#" />
  <button aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" /> // `tabIndex=-1` removes the element from sequential focus navigation so we don't flag it.
  <a href="/" />
  <div aria-hidden="true"><a href="#"></a></div> // This is also bad but will not be handled by this rule.

```markdown
# jsx-a11y/no-interactive-element-to-noninteractive-role

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Interactive HTML elements indicate _controls_ in the user interface. Interactive elements include `<a href>`, `<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`.

Non-interactive HTML elements and non-interactive ARIA roles indicate _content_ and _containers_ in the user interface. Non-interactive elements include `<main>`, `<area>`, `<h1>` (,`<h2>`, etc), `<img>`, `<li>`, `<ul>` and `<ol>`.

[WAI-ARIA roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#usage_intro) should not be used to convert an interactive element to a non-interactive element. Non-interactive ARIA roles include `article`, `banner`, `complementary`, `img`, `listitem`, `main`, `region` and `tooltip`.

## How do I resolve this error?

### Case: The element should be a container, like an article

Wrap your interactive element in a `<div>` with the desired role.

```jsx
<div role="article">
  <button>Save</button>
</div>
```

### Case: The element should be content, like an image

Put the content inside your interactive element.

```jsx
<div
  role="button"
  onClick={() => {}}
  onKeyPress={() => {}}
  tabIndex="0">
  <div role="img" aria-label="Save" />
</div>
```

## Rule options

The recommended options for this rule allow the `tr` element to be given a role of `presentation` (or its semantic equivalent `none`). Under normal circumstances, an element with an interactive role should not be semantically neutralized with `presentation` (or `none`).

Options are provided as an object keyed by HTML element name; the value is an array of interactive roles that are allowed on the specified element.

```js
{
  'no-interactive-element-to-noninteractive-role': [
    'error',
    {
      tr: ['none', 'presentation'],
    },
  ]
}
```

Under the recommended options, the following code is valid. It would be invalid under the strict rules.

```jsx
<tr role="presentation" />
```

# jsx-a11y/no-noninteractive-element-interactions

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Non-interactive HTML elements and non-interactive ARIA roles indicate _content_ and _containers_ in the user interface. A non-interactive element does not support event handlers (mouse and key handlers). Non-interactive elements include `<main>`, `<area>`, `<h1>` (,`<h2>`, etc), `<p>`, `<img>`, `<li>`, `<ul>` and `<ol>`. Non-interactive [WAI-ARIA roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#usage_intro) include `article`, `banner`, `complementary`, `img`, `listitem`, `main`, `region` and `tooltip`.

## How do I resolve this error?

### Case: This element acts like a button, link, menuitem, etc

Move the event handler function to an inner element that is either a semantically interactive element (`<button>`, `<a href>`) or that has an interactive role. This leaves the _content_ or _container_ semantic value of this element intact.

Common interactive roles include:

  1. `button`
  1. `link`
  1. `checkbox`
  1. `menuitem`
  1. `menuitemcheckbox`
  1. `menuitemradio`
  1. `option`
  1. `radio`
  1. `searchbox`
  1. `switch`
  1. `textbox`

Note: Adding a role to your element does **not** add behavior. When a semantic HTML element like `<button>` is used, then it will also respond to Enter key presses when it has focus. The developer is responsible for providing the expected behavior of an element that the role suggests it would have: focusability and key press support.
see [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide - Design Patterns and Widgets](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#aria_ex).

### Case: This element is catching bubbled events from elements that it contains

Move the event handler function to an inner element like `<div>` and give that element a role of `presentation`. This leaves the _content_ or _container_ semantic value of this element intact.

```jsx
<div role="article">
  <div
    onClick="onClickHandler"
    onKeyPress={onKeyPressHandler}
    role="presentation">
    {this.props.children}
  </div>
</div>
```

Marking an element with the role `presentation` indicates to assistive technology that this element should be ignored; it exists to support the web application and is not meant for humans to interact with directly.

### Case: This is a heading that expands/collapses content on the package

Headers often double as expand/collapse controls for the content they headline. An accordion component is a common example of this pattern. Rather than assign the interaction handling code to the heading itself, put a button inside the heading instead. This pattern retains the role of the heading and the role of the button.

```jsx
<h3>
  <button onClick={this._expandSection}>News</button>
</h3>
<ul id="articles-list">
  <li>...</li>
</ul>
```

### Case: This element is a table cell

Table cells (and tables in general) are meant to contain data. ARIA provides us with a construct called a [Grid](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#grid) that is essentially a 2 dimensional logical container for content and interactive elements.

You have two options in this case.

#### Option 1, move the interactive content inside the table cells

For instance, move the button inside the cell:

```jsx
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><button>Sort</button></td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

This preserves the table cell semantics and the button semantics; the two are not conflated on the cell.

#### Option 2, convert the table into an ARIA grid

If your user interface has a table-like layout, but is filled with interactive components in the cells, consider converting the table into a grid.

```jsx
<table role="grid">
  <tr>
    <td role="gridcell" onClick={this.sort}>Sort</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

You can also put the interactive content inside the grid cell. This maintains the semantic distinction between the cell and the interaction content, although a grid cell can be interactive.

## Rule options

You may configure which handler props should be taken into account when applying this rule. The recommended configuration includes the following 6 handlers.

```javascript
'jsx-a11y/no-noninteractive-element-interactions': [
  'error',
  {
    handlers: [
      'onClick',
      'onMouseDown',
      'onMouseUp',
      'onKeyPress',
      'onKeyDown',
      'onKeyUp',
    ],
  },
],
```

Adjust the list of handler prop names in the handlers array to increase or decrease the coverage surface of this rule in your codebase.

### Succeed

```jsx
<div onClick={() => void 0} role="button" />
<div onClick={() => void 0} role="presentation" />
<input type="text" onClick={() => void 0} /> // Interactive element does not require role.
<button onClick={() => void 0} className="foo" /> // button is interactive.
<div onClick={() => void 0} role="button" aria-hidden /> // This is hidden from screen reader.
<Input onClick={() => void 0} type="hidden" /> // This is a higher-level DOM component
```

### Fail

```jsx
<li onClick={() => void 0} />
<div onClick={() => void 0} role="listitem" />
```

```markdown
# jsx-a11y/no-noninteractive-element-to-interactive-role

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Non-interactive HTML elements indicate _content_ and _containers_ in the user interface. Non-interactive elements include `<main>`, `<area>`, `<h1>` (,`<h2>`, etc), `<img>`, `<li>`, `<ul>` and `<ol>`.

Interactive HTML elements indicate _controls_ in the user interface. Interactive elements include `<a href>`, `<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`.

[WAI-ARIA roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#usage_intro) should not be used to convert a non-interactive element to an interactive element. Interactive ARIA roles include `button`, `link`, `checkbox`, `menuitem`, `menuitemcheckbox`, `menuitemradio`, `option`, `radio`, `searchbox`, `switch` and `textbox`.

## How do I resolve this error?

### Case: This element should be a control, like a button

Put the control inside the non-interactive container element.

```jsx
<li>
  <div
    role="button"
    onClick={() => {}}
    onKeyPress={() => {}}>
    Save
  </div>
</li>
```

Or wrap the content inside your interactive element.

```jsx
<div
  role="button"
  onClick={() => {}}
  onKeyPress={() => {}}
  tabIndex="0">
  <img src="some/file.png" alt="Save" />
</div>
```

## Rule options

The recommended options for this rule allow several common interactive roles to be applied to a non-interactive element. The options are provided as an object keyed by HTML element name; the value is an array of interactive roles that are allowed on the specified element.

```js
{
  'no-noninteractive-element-to-interactive-role': [
    'error',
    {
      ul: ['listbox', 'menu', 'menubar', 'radiogroup', 'tablist', 'tree', 'treegrid'],
      ol: ['listbox', 'menu', 'menubar', 'radiogroup', 'tablist', 'tree', 'treegrid'],
      li: ['menuitem', 'option', 'row', 'tab', 'treeitem'],
      table: ['grid'],
      td: ['gridcell'],
    },
  ]
}
```

Under the recommended options, the following code is valid. It would be invalid under the strict rules.

```jsx
<ul role="menu" />
```

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/docs/rules/no-noninteractive-tabindex.md`
```markdown
# jsx-a11y/no-noninteractive-tabindex

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Tab key navigation should be limited to elements on the page that can be interacted with. Thus it is not necessary to add a tabindex to items in an unordered list, for example, to make them navigable through assistive technology. These applications already afford page traversal mechanisms based on the HTML of the page. Generally, we should try to reduce the size of the page's tab ring rather than increasing it.

## How do I resolve this error?

### Case: I am using an `<a>` tag. Isn't that interactive?

The `<a>` tag is tricky. Consider the following:

```jsx
<a>Edit</a>
<a href="#">Edit</a>
<a role="button">Edit</a>
```

The bare `<a>` tag is an _anchor_. It has no semantic AX API mapping in either ARIA or the AXObject model. It's as meaningful as `<div>`, which is to say it has no meaning. An `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute has an inherent role of `link`. An `<a>` tag with an explicit role obtains the designated role. In the example above, this role is `button`.

### Case: I am using "semantic" HTML. Isn't that interactive?

If we take a step back into the field of linguistics for a moment, let's consider what it means for something to be "semantic". Nothing, in and of itself, has meaning. Meaning is constructed through dialogue. A speaker intends a meaning and a listener/observer interprets a meaning. Each participant constructs their own meaning through dialogue. There is no intrinsic or isolated meaning outside of interaction. Thus, we must ask, given that we have a "speaker" who communicates via "semantic" HTML, who is listening/observing?

In our case, the observer is the Accessibility (AX) API. Browsers interpret HTML (inflected at times by ARIA) to construct a meaning (AX Tree) of the page. Whatever the semantic HTML intends has only the force of suggestion to the AX API. Therefore, we have inconsistencies. For example, there is not yet an ARIA role for `text` or `label` and thus no way to change a `<label>` into plain text or a `<span>` into a label via ARIA. `<div>` has an AXObject correpondant `DivRole`, but no such object maps to `<span>`.

What this lint rule endeavors to do is apply the AX API understanding of the semantics of an HTML document back onto your code. The concept of interactivity boils down to whether a user can do something with the indicated or focused component.

Common interactive roles include:

  1. `button`
  1. `link`
  1. `checkbox`
  1. `menuitem`
  1. `menuitemcheckbox`
  1. `menuitemradio`
  1. `option`
  1. `radio`
  1. `searchbox`
  1. `switch`
  1. `textbox`

Endeavor to limit tabbable elements to those that a user can act upon.

### Case: Shouldn't I add a tabindex so that users can navigate to this item?

It is not necessary to put a tabindex on an `<article>`, for instance or on `<li>` items; assistive technologies provide affordances to users to find and traverse these containers. Most elements that require a tabindex -- `<a href>`, `<button>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>` -- have it already.

Your application might require an exception to this rule in the case of an element that captures incoming tab traversal for a composite widget. In that case, turn off this rule on a per instance basis. This is an uncommon case.

If you know that a particular element will be scrollable, you might want to add `tabindex="0"` if your website supports browsers that don't make these containers keyboard-focusable. The current status for this platform feature can be tracked in [Chrome Platform Status "Feature: Keyboard-focusable scroll containers"](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5231964663578624).

```jsx
// eslint-disable-next-line no-noninteractive-tabindex
<pre tabIndex="0">
  <code>{someLongCode}</code>
</pre>
```

## Rule options

The recommended options for this rule allow `tabIndex` on elements with the noninteractive `tabpanel` role. Adding `tabIndex` to a tabpanel is a recommended practice in some instances.

```javascript
'jsx-a11y/no-noninteractive-tabindex': [
  'error',
  {
    tags: [],
    roles: ['tabpanel'],
    allowExpressionValues: true,
  },
]
```

The `allowExpressionValues` option determines whether the `role` attribute is allowed to be assigned using an expression. For example, the following would pass in recommended mode if `allowExpressionValues` is set to be `true`:

```jsx
<div role={ROLE_BUTTON} onClick={() => {}} tabIndex="0" />;
// In case of a conditional expression, there should be literals on both sides of ternary operator
<div role={isButton ? "button" : "link"} onClick={() => {}} tabIndex="0" />;
```

### Succeed

```jsx
<div />
<MyButton tabIndex={0} />
<button />
<button tabIndex="0" />
<button tabIndex={0} />
<div />
<div tabIndex="-1" />
<div role="button" tabIndex="0" />
<div role="article" tabIndex="-1" />
<article tabIndex="-1" />
```

### Fail

```jsx
<div tabIndex="0" />
<div role="article" tabIndex="0" />
<article tabIndex="0" />
<article tabIndex={0} />
```

# jsx-a11y/no-onchange

❌ This rule is deprecated.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

⚠️ **Deprecated:** This rule is based on reports of behavior of [old browsers (eg. IE 10 and below)](https://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/change.html#t05). In the meantime, this behavior has been corrected, both in newer versions of browsers as well as [in the DOM spec](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=969068#c2).

Enforce usage of `onBlur` over/in parallel with `onChange` on select menu elements for accessibility. `onBlur` **should** be used instead of `onChange`, unless absolutely necessary and it causes no negative consequences for keyboard only or screen reader users. `onBlur` is a more declarative action by the user: for instance in a dropdown, using the arrow keys to toggle between options will trigger the `onChange` event in some browsers. Regardless, when a change of context results from an `onBlur` event or an `onChange` event, the user should be notified of the change unless it occurs below the currently focused element.

## Rule details

This rule takes no arguments.

# jsx-a11y/no-redundant-roles

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Some HTML elements have native semantics that are implemented by the browser. This includes default/implicit ARIA roles. Setting an ARIA role that matches its default/implicit role is redundant since it is already set by the browser.

## Rule options

The default options for this rule allow an implicit role of `navigation` to be applied to a `nav` element as is [advised by w3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_HTML5_nav_element#Example:The_.3Cnav.3E_element). The options are provided as an object keyed by HTML element name; the value is an array of implicit ARIA roles that are allowed on the specified element.

### Fichier : `./node_modules/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/docs/rules/no-static-element-interactions.md`
```markdown
# jsx-a11y/no-static-element-interactions

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Static HTML elements do not have semantic meaning. This is clear in the case of `<div>` and `<span>`. It is less so clear in the case of elements that _seem_ semantic, but that do not have a semantic mapping in the accessibility layer. For example `<a>`, `<big>`, `<blockquote>`, `<footer>`, `<picture>`, `<strike>` and `<time>` -- to name a few -- have no semantic layer mapping. They are as void of meaning as `<div>`.

The [WAI-ARIA `role` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#usage_intro) confers a semantic mapping to an element. The semantic value can then be expressed to a user via assistive technology.

In order to add interactivity such as a mouse or key event listener to a static element, that element must be given a role value as well.

## How do I resolve this error?

### Case: This element acts like a button, link, menuitem, etc

Indicate the element's role with the `role` attribute:

```jsx
<div
  onClick={onClickHandler}
  onKeyPress={onKeyPressHandler}
  role="button"
  tabindex="0">
  Save
</div>
```

Common interactive roles include:

  1. `button`
  1. `link`
  1. `checkbox`
  1. `menuitem`
  1. `menuitemcheckbox`
  1. `menuitemradio`
  1. `option`
  1. `radio`
  1. `searchbox`
  1. `switch`
  1. `textbox`

Note: Adding a role to your element does **not** add behavior. When a semantic HTML element like `<button>` is used, then it will also respond to Enter key presses when it has focus. The developer is responsible for providing the expected behavior of an element that the role suggests it would have: focusability and key press support.

### Case: The event handler is only being used to capture bubbled events

If your element is catching bubbled click or key events from descendant elements, there are no appropriate roles for your element: you will have to deactivate the rule. Consider explaining the reason for disabling the rule as well.

```jsx
{/* The <div> element has a child <button> element that allows keyboard interaction */}
{/* eslint-disable-next-line jsx-a11y/no-static-element-interactions */}
<div onClick={this.handleButtonClick}>
  <button>Save</button>
  <button>Cancel</button>
</div>
```

Do not use the role `presentation` on the element: it removes the element's semantics, and may also remove its children's semantics, creating big issues with assistive technology.

## Rule options

You may configure which handler props should be taken into account when applying this rule. The recommended configuration includes the following 6 handlers and the `allowExpressionValues` option.

```javascript
'jsx-a11y/no-static-element-interactions': [
  'error',
  {
    handlers: [
      'onClick',
      'onMouseDown',
      'onMouseUp',
      'onKeyPress',
      'onKeyDown',
      'onKeyUp',
    ],
    allowExpressionValues: true,
  },
],
```

Adjust the list of handler prop names in the handlers array to increase or decrease the coverage surface of this rule in your codebase.

The `allowExpressionValues` option determines whether the `role` attribute is allowed to be assigned using an expression. For example, the following would pass in recommended mode if `allowExpressionValues` is set to be `true`:

```jsx
<div role={ROLE_BUTTON} onClick={() => {}} />;
// In case of a conditional expression, there should be literals on both sides of ternary operator
<div role={isButton ? "button" : "link"} onClick={() => {}} />;
```

### Succeed

```jsx
<button onClick={() => {}} className="foo" />
<div className="foo" onClick={() => {}} role="button" />
<input type="text" onClick={() => {}} />
```

### Fail

```jsx
<div onClick={() => {}} />
```

# find-up [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sindresorhus/find-up.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/sindresorhus/find-up)

> Find a file or directory by walking up parent directories

## Install

```
$ npm install find-up
```

## Usage

```
/
└── Users
    └── sindresorhus
        ├── unicorn.png
        └── foo
            └── bar
                ├── baz
                └── example.js
```

`example.js`

```js
const path = require('path');
const findUp = require('find-up');

(async () => {
	console.log(await findUp('unicorn.png'));
	//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/unicorn.png'

	console.log(await findUp(['rainbow.png', 'unicorn.png']));
	//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/unicorn.png'

	console.log(await findUp(async directory => {
		const hasUnicorns = await findUp.exists(path.join(directory, 'unicorn.png'));
		return hasUnicorns && directory;
	}, {type: 'directory'}));
	//=> '/Users/sindresorhus'
})();
```

## API

### findUp(name, options?)
### findUp(matcher, options?)

Returns a `Promise` for either the path or `undefined` if it couldn't be found.

### findUp([...name], options?)

Returns a `Promise` for either the first path found (by respecting the order of the array) or `undefined` if none could be found.

### findUp.sync(name, options?)
### findUp.sync(matcher, options?)

Returns a path or `undefined` if it couldn't be found.

### findUp.sync([...name], options?)

Returns the first path found (by respecting the order of the array) or `undefined` if none could be found.

#### name

Type: `string`

Name of the file or directory to find.

#### matcher

Type: `Function`

A function that will be called with each directory until it returns a `string` with the path, which stops the search, or the root directory has been reached and nothing was found. Useful if you want to match files with certain patterns, set of permissions, or other advanced use-cases.

When using async mode, the `matcher` may optionally be an async or promise-returning function that returns the path.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### cwd

Type: `string`\
Default: `process.cwd()`

Directory to start from.

##### type

Type: `string`\
Default: `'file'`\
Values: `'file'` `'directory'`

The type of paths that can match.

##### allowSymlinks

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `true`

Allow symbolic links to match if they point to the chosen path type.

### findUp.exists(path)

Returns a `Promise<boolean>` of whether the path exists.

### findUp.sync.exists(path)

Returns a `boolean` of whether the path exists.

#### path

Type: `string`

Path to a file or directory.

### findUp.stop

A [`Symbol`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) that can be returned by a `matcher` function to stop the search and cause `findUp` to immediately return `undefined`. Useful as a performance optimization in case the current working directory is deeply nested in the filesystem.

```js
const path = require('path');
const findUp = require('find-up');

(async () => {
	await findUp(directory => {
		return path.basename(directory) === 'work' ? findUp.stop : 'logo.png';
	});
})();
```

    - Added glob disable to wrong call
    - Wrapped rimraf to simplify solution

- **Refactoring**
  - remove yarn.lock file - [704c6c4](https://github.com/royriojas/flat-cache/commit/704c6c4), [Roy Riojas](https://github.com/Roy Riojas), 07/11/2018 15:41:08

  - Do not crash if cache file is invalid JSON. ([#13](https://github.com/royriojas/flat-cache/issues/13)) - [87beaa6](https://github.com/royriojas/flat-cache/commit/87beaa6), [Roy Riojas](https://github.com/Roy Riojas), 19/12/2016 18:03:35

    Fixes <a target="_blank" class="info-link" href="https://github.com/royriojas/flat-cache/issues/12"><span>#12</span></a>

    Not sure under which situations a cache file might exist that does
    not contain a valid JSON structure, but just in case to cover
    the possibility of this happening a try catch block has been added

    If the cache is somehow not valid the cache will be discarded an a
    a new cache will be stored instead

- **Other changes**

    As mentioned in https://github.com/WebReflection/circular-json/issues/25 `circular-json` wan't rightly implementing the license field.

    Latest version bump changed only that bit so that ESLint should now be happy.

# globals

> Global identifiers from different JavaScript environments

It's just a [JSON file](globals.json), so use it in any environment.

This package is used by ESLint.

**This package [no longer accepts](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globals/issues/82) new environments. If you need it for ESLint, just [create a plugin](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-plugins#environments-in-plugins).**

## Install

```sh
npm install globals
```

## Usage

```js
const globals = require('globals');

console.log(globals.browser);
/*
{
	addEventListener: false,
	applicationCache: false,
	ArrayBuffer: false,
	atob: false,
	…
}
*/
```

Each global is given a value of `true` or `false`. A value of `true` indicates that the variable may be overwritten. A value of `false` indicates that the variable should be considered read-only. This information is used by static analysis tools to flag incorrect behavior. We assume all variables should be `false` unless we hear otherwise.

For Node.js this package provides two sets of globals:

- `globals.nodeBuiltin`: Globals available to all code running in Node.js.
	These will usually be available as properties on the `global` object and include `process`, `Buffer`, but not CommonJS arguments like `require`.
	See: https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html
- `globals.node`: A combination of the globals from `nodeBuiltin` plus all CommonJS arguments ("CommonJS module scope").
	See: https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_the_module_scope

When analyzing code that is known to run outside of a CommonJS wrapper, for example, JavaScript modules, `nodeBuiltin` can find accidental CommonJS references.

```

# import-fresh

> Import a module while bypassing the [cache](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_caching)

Useful for testing purposes when you need to freshly import a module.

## ESM

For ESM, you can use this snippet:

```js
const importFresh = moduleName => import(`${moduleName}?${Date.now()}`);

const {default: foo} = await importFresh('foo');
```

**This snippet causes a memory leak, so only use it for short-lived tests.**

## Install

```sh
npm install import-fresh
```

## Usage

```js
// foo.js
let i = 0;
module.exports = () => ++i;
```

```js
const importFresh = require('import-fresh');

require('./foo')();
//=> 1

require('./foo')();
//=> 2

importFresh('./foo')();
//=> 1

importFresh('./foo')();
//=> 1
```

### Fichier : `./node_modules/js-tokens/CHANGELOG.md`
```markdown
### Version 4.0.0 (2018-01-28) ###

- Added: Support for ES2018. The only change needed was recognizing the `s`
  regex flag.
- Changed: _All_ tokens returned by the `matchToToken` function now have a
  `closed` property. It is set to `undefined` for the tokens where “closed”
  doesn’t make sense. This means that all tokens objects have the same shape,
  which might improve performance.

These are the breaking changes:

- `'/a/s'.match(jsTokens)` no longer returns `['/', 'a', '/', 's']`, but
  `['/a/s']`. (There are of course other variations of this.)
- Code that rely on some token objects not having the `closed` property could
  now behave differently.


### Version 3.0.2 (2017-06-28) ###

- No code changes. Just updates to the readme.


### Version 3.0.1 (2017-01-30) ###

- Fixed: ES2015 unicode escapes with more than 6 hex digits are now matched
  correctly.


### Version 3.0.0 (2017-01-11) ###

This release contains one breaking change, that should [improve performance in
V8][v8-perf]:

> So how can you, as a JavaScript developer, ensure that your RegExps are fast?
> If you are not interested in hooking into RegExp internals, make sure that
> neither the RegExp instance, nor its prototype is modified in order to get the
> best performance:
>
> ```js
> var re = /./g;
> re.exec('');  // Fast path.
> re.new_property = 'slow';
> ```

This module used to export a single regex, with `.matchToToken` bolted
on, just like in the above example. This release changes the exports of
the module to avoid this issue.

Before:

```js
import jsTokens from "js-tokens"
// or:
var jsTokens = require("js-tokens")
var matchToToken = jsTokens.matchToToken
```

After:

```js
import jsTokens, {matchToToken} from "js-tokens"
// or:
var jsTokens = require("js-tokens").default
var matchToToken = require("js-tokens").matchToToken
```

[v8-perf]: http://v8project.blogspot.se/2017/01/speeding-up-v8-regular-expressions.html


### Version 2.0.0 (2016-06-19) ###

- Added: Support for ES2016. In other words, support for the `**` exponentiation
  operator.

These are the breaking changes:

- `'**'.match(jsTokens)` no longer returns `['*', '*']`, but `['**']`.
- `'**='.match(jsTokens)` no longer returns `['*', '*=']`, but `['**=']`.


### Version 1.0.3 (2016-03-27) ###

- Improved: Made the regex ever so slightly smaller.
- Updated: The readme.


### Version 1.0.2 (2015-10-18) ###

- Improved: Limited npm package contents for a smaller download. Thanks to
  @zertosh!


### Version 1.0.1 (2015-06-20) ###

- Fixed: Declared an undeclared variable.


### Version 1.0.0 (2015-02-26) ###

- Changed: Merged the 'operator' and 'punctuation' types into 'punctuator'. That
  type is now equivalent to the Punctuator token in the ECMAScript
  specification. (Backwards-incompatible change.)
- Fixed: A `-` followed by a number is now correctly matched as a punctuator
  followed by a number. It used to be matched as just a number, but there is no
  such thing as negative number literals. (Possibly backwards-incompatible
  change.)


### Version 0.4.1 (2015-02-21) ###

- Added: Support for the regex `u` flag.


### Version 0.4.0 (2015-02-21) ###

- Improved: `jsTokens.matchToToken` performance.
- Added: Support for octal and binary number literals.
- Added: Support for template strings.


### Version 0.3.1 (2015-01-06) ###

- Fixed: Support for unicode spaces. They used to be allowed in names (which is
  very confusing), and some unicode newlines were wrongly allowed in strings and
  regexes.


### Version 0.3.0 (2014-12-19) ###

- Changed: The `jsTokens.names` array has been replaced with the
  `jsTokens.matchToToken` function. The capturing groups of `jsTokens` are no
  longer part of the public API; instead use said function. See this [gist] for
  an example. (Backwards-incompatible change.)
- Changed: The empty string is now considered an “invalid” token, instead an
  “empty” token (its own group). (Backwards-incompatible change.)
- Removed: component support. (Backwards-incompatible change.)

[gist]: https://gist.github.com/lydell/be49dbf80c382c473004


### Version 0.2.0 (2014-06-19) ###

- Changed: Match ES6 function arrows (`=>`) as an operator, instead of its own
  category (“functionArrow”), for simplicity. (Backwards-incompatible change.)
- Added: ES6 splats (`...`) are now matched as an operator (instead of three
  punctuations). (Backwards-incompatible change.)


### Version 0.1.0 (2014-03-08) ###

- Initial release.

```

# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [4.1.0] - 2021-04-15
### Added
- Types are now exported as `yaml.types.XXX`.
- Every type now has `options` property with original arguments kept as they were
  (see `yaml.types.int.options` as an example).

### Changed
- `Schema.extend()` now keeps old type order in case of conflicts
  (e.g. Schema.extend([ a, b, c ]).extend([ b, a, d ]) is now ordered as `abcd` instead of `cbad`).


## [4.0.0] - 2021-01-03
### Changed
- Check [migration guide](migrate_v3_to_v4.md) to see details for all breaking changes.
- Breaking: "unsafe" tags `!!js/function`, `!!js/regexp`, `!!js/undefined` are
  moved to [js-yaml-js-types](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml-js-types) package.
- Breaking: removed `safe*` functions. Use `load`, `loadAll`, `dump`
  instead which are all now safe by default.
- `yaml.DEFAULT_SAFE_SCHEMA` and `yaml.DEFAULT_FULL_SCHEMA` are removed, use
  `yaml.DEFAULT_SCHEMA` instead.
- `yaml.Schema.create(schema, tags)` is removed, use `schema.extend(tags)` instead.
- `!!binary` now always mapped to `Uint8Array` on load.
- Reduced nesting of `/lib` folder.
- Parse numbers according to YAML 1.2 instead of YAML 1.1 (`01234` is now decimal,
  `0o1234` is octal, `1:23` is parsed as string instead of base60).
- `dump()` no longer quotes `:`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)` except when necessary, #470, #557.
- Line and column in exceptions are now formatted as `(X:Y)` instead of
  `at line X, column Y` (also present in compact format), #332.
- Code snippet created in exceptions now contains multiple lines with line numbers.
- `dump()` now serializes `undefined` as `null` in collections and removes keys with
  `undefined` in mappings, #571.
- `dump()` with `skipInvalid=true` now serializes invalid items in collections as null.
- Custom tags starting with `!` are now dumped as `!tag` instead of `!<!tag>`, #576.
- Custom tags starting with `tag:yaml.org,2002:` are now shorthanded using `!!`, #258.

### Added
- Added `.mjs` (es modules) support.
- Added `quotingType` and `forceQuotes` options for dumper to configure
  string literal style, #290, #529.
- Added `styles: { '!!null': 'empty' }` option for dumper
  (serializes `{ foo: null }` as "`foo: `"), #570.
- Added `replacer` option (similar to option in JSON.stringify), #339.
- Custom `Tag` can now handle all tags or multiple tags with the same prefix, #385.

### Fixed
- Astral characters are no longer encoded by `dump()`, #587.
- "duplicate mapping key" exception now points at the correct column, #452.
- Extra commas in flow collections (e.g. `[foo,,bar]`) now throw an exception
  instead of producing null, #321.
- `__proto__` key no longer overrides object prototype, #164.
- Removed `bower.json`.
- Tags are now url-decoded in `load()` and url-encoded in `dump()`
  (previously usage of custom non-ascii tags may have led to invalid YAML that can't be parsed).
- Anchors now work correctly with empty nodes, #301.
- Fix incorrect parsing of invalid block mapping syntax, #418.
- Throw an error if block sequence/mapping indent contains a tab, #80.

	'pony.png'
];

(async () => {
	console(await locatePath(files));
	//=> 'rainbow'
})();
```

# ms

![CI](https://github.com/vercel/ms/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Use this package to easily convert various time formats to milliseconds.

## Examples

```js
ms('2 days')  // 172800000
ms('1d')      // 86400000
ms('10h')     // 36000000
ms('2.5 hrs') // 9000000
ms('2h')      // 7200000
ms('1m')      // 60000
ms('5s')      // 5000
ms('1y')      // 31557600000
ms('100')     // 100
ms('-3 days') // -259200000
ms('-1h')     // -3600000
ms('-200')    // -200
```

### Convert from Milliseconds

```js
ms(60000)             // "1m"
ms(2 * 60000)         // "2m"
ms(-3 * 60000)        // "-3m"
ms(ms('10 hours'))    // "10h"
```

### Time Format Written-Out

```js
ms(60000, { long: true })             // "1 minute"
ms(2 * 60000, { long: true })         // "2 minutes"
ms(-3 * 60000, { long: true })        // "-3 minutes"
ms(ms('10 hours'), { long: true })    // "10 hours"
```

## Features

- Works both in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and in the browser
- If a number is supplied to `ms`, a string with a unit is returned
- If a string that contains the number is supplied, it returns it as a number (e.g.: it returns `100` for `'100'`)
- If you pass a string with a number and a valid unit, the number of equivalent milliseconds is returned

## Related Packages

- [ms.macro](https://github.com/knpwrs/ms.macro) - Run `ms` as a macro at build-time.

## Caught a Bug?

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
2. Link the package to the global module directory: `npm link`
3. Within the module you want to test your local development instance of ms, just link it to the dependencies: `npm link ms`. Instead of the default one from npm, Node.js will now use your clone of ms!

As always, you can run the tests using: `npm test`

```

# object-assign [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/object-assign.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/object-assign)

> ES2015 [`Object.assign()`](http://www.2ality.com/2014/01/object-assign.html) [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com)


## Use the built-in

Node.js 4 and up, as well as every evergreen browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, Safari),
support `Object.assign()` :tada:. If you target only those environments, then by all
means, use `Object.assign()` instead of this package.


## Install

```
$ npm install --save object-assign
```


## Usage

```js
const objectAssign = require('object-assign');

objectAssign({foo: 0}, {bar: 1});
//=> {foo: 0, bar: 1}

// multiple sources
objectAssign({foo: 0}, {bar: 1}, {baz: 2});
//=> {foo: 0, bar: 1, baz: 2}

// overwrites equal keys
objectAssign({foo: 0}, {foo: 1}, {foo: 2});
//=> {foo: 2}

// ignores null and undefined sources
objectAssign({foo: 0}, null, {bar: 1}, undefined);
//=> {foo: 0, bar: 1}
```


## API

### objectAssign(target, [source, ...])

Assigns enumerable own properties of `source` objects to the `target` object and returns the `target` object. Additional `source` objects will overwrite previous ones.

### Fichier : `./node_modules/p-limit/readme.md`
```markdown
# p-limit

> Run multiple promise-returning & async functions with limited concurrency

## Install

```
$ npm install p-limit
```

## Usage

```js
const pLimit = require('p-limit');

const limit = pLimit(1);

const input = [
	limit(() => fetchSomething('foo')),
	limit(() => fetchSomething('bar')),
	limit(() => doSomething())
];

(async () => {
	// Only one promise is run at once
	const result = await Promise.all(input);
	console.log(result);
})();
```

## API

### pLimit(concurrency)

Returns a `limit` function.

#### concurrency

Type: `number`\
Minimum: `1`\
Default: `Infinity`

Concurrency limit.

### limit(fn, ...args)

Returns the promise returned by calling `fn(...args)`.

#### fn

Type: `Function`

Promise-returning/async function.

#### args

Any arguments to pass through to `fn`.

Support for passing arguments on to the `fn` is provided in order to be able to avoid creating unnecessary closures. You probably don't need this optimization unless you're pushing a *lot* of functions.

### limit.activeCount

The number of promises that are currently running.

### limit.pendingCount

The number of promises that are waiting to run (i.e. their internal `fn` was not called yet).

### limit.clearQueue()

Discard pending promises that are waiting to run.

This might be useful if you want to teardown the queue at the end of your program's lifecycle or discard any function calls referencing an intermediary state of your app.

Note: This does not cancel promises that are already running.

## FAQ

### How is this different from the [`p-queue`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-queue) package?

This package is only about limiting the number of concurrent executions, while `p-queue` is a fully featured queue implementation with lots of different options, introspection, and ability to pause the queue.

```markdown
# p-locate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sindresorhus/p-locate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/sindresorhus/p-locate)

> Get the first fulfilled promise that satisfies the provided testing function

Think of it like an async version of [`Array#find`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find).

## Install

```
$ npm install p-locate
```

## Usage

Here we find the first file that exists on disk, in array order.

```js
const pathExists = require('path-exists');
const pLocate = require('p-locate');

const files = [
	'unicorn.png',
	'rainbow.png', // Only this one actually exists on disk
	'pony.png'
];

(async () => {
	const foundPath = await pLocate(files, file => pathExists(file));

	console.log(foundPath);
	//=> 'rainbow'
})();
```

*The above is just an example. Use [`locate-path`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/locate-path) if you need this.*

## API

### pLocate(input, tester, options?)

Returns a `Promise` that is fulfilled when `tester` resolves to `true` or the iterable is done, or rejects if any of the promises reject. The fulfilled value is the current iterable value or `undefined` if `tester` never resolved to `true`.

#### input

Type: `Iterable<Promise | unknown>`

An iterable of promises/values to test.

#### tester(element)

Type: `Function`

This function will receive resolved values from `input` and is expected to return a `Promise<boolean>` or `boolean`.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### concurrency

Type: `number`\
Default: `Infinity`\
Minimum: `1`

Number of concurrently pending promises returned by `tester`.

##### preserveOrder

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `true`

Preserve `input` order when searching.

Disable this to improve performance if you don't care about the order.

```markdown
# parent-module [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/parent-module.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/parent-module)

> Get the path of the parent module

Node.js exposes `module.parent`, but it only gives you the first cached parent, which is not necessarily the actual parent.


## Install

```
$ npm install parent-module
```


## Usage

```js
// bar.js
const parentModule = require('parent-module');

module.exports = () => {
	console.log(parentModule());
	//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/dev/unicorn/foo.js'
};
```

```js
// foo.js
const bar = require('./bar');

bar();
```


## API

### parentModule([filepath])

By default, it will return the path of the immediate parent.

#### filepath

Type: `string`<br>
Default: [`__filename`](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_filename)

Filepath of the module of which to get the parent path.

Useful if you want it to work [multiple module levels down](https://github.com/sindresorhus/parent-module/tree/master/fixtures/filepath).


## Tip

Combine it with [`read-pkg-up`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/read-pkg-up) to read the package.json of the parent module.

```js
const path = require('path');
const readPkgUp = require('read-pkg-up');
const parentModule = require('parent-module');

console.log(readPkgUp.sync({cwd: path.dirname(parentModule())}).pkg);
//=> {name: 'chalk', version: '1.0.0', …}
```

```markdown
# path-exists [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/path-exists.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/path-exists)

> Check if a path exists

NOTE: `fs.existsSync` has been un-deprecated in Node.js since 6.8.0. If you only need to check synchronously, this module is not needed.

While [`fs.exists()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_exists_path_callback) is being [deprecated](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/issues/103), there's still a genuine use-case of being able to check if a path exists for other purposes than doing IO with it.

Never use this before handling a file though:

> In particular, checking if a file exists before opening it is an anti-pattern that leaves you vulnerable to race conditions: another process may remove the file between the calls to `fs.exists()` and `fs.open()`. Just open the file and handle the error when it's not there.


## Install

```
$ npm install path-exists
```


## Usage

```js
// foo.js
const pathExists = require('path-exists');

(async () => {
	console.log(await pathExists('foo.js'));
	//=> true
})();
```


## API

### pathExists(path)

Returns a `Promise<boolean>` of whether the path exists.

### pathExists.sync(path)

Returns a `boolean` of whether the path exists.

# path-key [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/path-key.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/path-key)

> Get the [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)) environment variable key cross-platform

It's usually `PATH`, but on Windows it can be any casing like `Path`...


## Install

```
$ npm install path-key
```


## Usage

```js
const pathKey = require('path-key');

const key = pathKey();
//=> 'PATH'

const PATH = process.env[key];
//=> '/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin'
```


## API

### pathKey(options?)

#### options

Type: `object`

##### env

Type: `object`<br>
Default: [`process.env`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_env)

Use a custom environment variables object.

#### platform

Type: `string`<br>
Default: [`process.platform`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_platform)

Get the PATH key for a specific platform.

- added `List` functions: `at`, `elem-index`, `elem-indices`, `find-index`, `find-indices`
- added `Str` functions: `capitalize`, `camelize`, `dasherize`
- added `Func` function: `over` - eg. ``same-length = (==) `over` (.length)``
- exported `Str.repeat` through main `prelude` object
- fixed definition of `foldr` and `foldr1`, the new correct definition is backwards incompatible with the old, incorrect one
- fixed issue with `fix`
- improved code coverage

# 1.0.3
- build browser versions

# 1.0.2
- bug fix for `flatten` - slight change with bug fix, flattens arrays only, not array-like objects

# 1.0.1
- bug fixes for `drop-while` and `take-while`

# 1.0.0
* massive update - separated functions into separate modules
* functions do not accept multiple types anymore - use different versions in their respective modules in some cases (eg. `Obj.map`), or use `chars` or `values` in other cases to transform into a list
* objects are no longer transformed into functions, simply use `(obj.)` in LiveScript to do that
* browser version now using browserify - use `prelude = require('prelude-ls')`
* added `compact`, `split`, `flatten`, `difference`, `intersection`, `union`, `count-by`, `group-by`, `chars`, `unchars`, `apply`
* added `lists-to-obj` which takes a list of keys and list of values and zips them up into an object, and the converse `obj-to-lists`
* added `pairs-to-obj` which takes a list of pairs (2 element lists) and creates an object, and the converse `obj-to-pairs`
* removed `cons`, `append` - use the concat operator
* removed `compose` - use the compose operator
* removed `obj-to-func` - use partially applied access (eg. `(obj.)`)
* removed `length` - use `(.length)`
* `sort-by` renamed to `sort-with`
* added new `sort-by`
* removed `compare` - just use the new `sort-by`
* `break-it` renamed `break-list`, (`Str.break-str` for the string version)
* added `Str.repeat` which creates a new string by repeating the input n times
* `unfold` as alias to `unfoldr` is no longer used
* fixed up style and compiled with LiveScript 1.1.1
* use Make instead of Slake
* greatly improved tests

# 0.6.0
* fixed various bugs
* added `fix`, a fixpoint (Y combinator) for anonymous recursive functions
* added `unfoldr` (alias `unfold`)
* calling `replicate` with a string now returns a list of strings
* removed `partial`, just use native partial application in LiveScript using the `_` placeholder, or currying
* added `sort`, `sortBy`, and `compare`

# 0.5.0
* removed `lookup` - use (.prop)
* removed `call` - use (.func arg1, arg2)
* removed `pluck` - use map (.prop), xs
* fixed buys wtih `head` and `last`
* added non-minifed browser version, as `prelude-browser.js`
* renamed `prelude-min.js` to `prelude-browser-min.js`
* renamed `zip` to `zipAll`
* renamed `zipWith` to `zipAllWith`
* added `zip`, a curried zip that takes only two arguments
* added `zipWith`, a curried zipWith that takes only two arguments

# 0.4.0
* added `parition` function
* added `curry` function
* removed `elem` function (use `in`)
* removed `notElem` function (use `not in`)

# 0.3.0
* added `listToObject`
* added `unique`
* added `objToFunc`
* added support for using strings in map and the like
* added support for using objects in map and the like
* added ability to use objects instead of functions in certain cases
* removed `error` (just use throw)
* added `tau` constant
* added `join`
* added `values`
* added `keys`
* added `partial`
* renamed `log` to `ln`
* added alias to `head`: `first`
* added `installPrelude` helper

# 0.2.0
* removed functions that simply warp operators as you can now use operators as functions in LiveScript
* `min/max` are now curried and take only 2 arguments
* added `call`

# 0.1.0
* initial public release

# resolve-from [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/resolve-from.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/resolve-from)

> Resolve the path of a module like [`require.resolve()`](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_require_resolve) but from a given path


## Install

```
$ npm install resolve-from
```


## Usage

```js
const resolveFrom = require('resolve-from');

// There is a file at `./foo/bar.js`

resolveFrom('foo', './bar');
//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/dev/test/foo/bar.js'
```


## API

### resolveFrom(fromDir, moduleId)

Like `require()`, throws when the module can't be found.

### resolveFrom.silent(fromDir, moduleId)

Returns `null` instead of throwing when the module can't be found.

#### fromDir

Type: `string`

Directory to resolve from.

#### moduleId

Type: `string`

What you would use in `require()`.


## Tip

Create a partial using a bound function if you want to resolve from the same `fromDir` multiple times:

```js
const resolveFromFoo = resolveFrom.bind(null, 'foo');

resolveFromFoo('./bar');
resolveFromFoo('./baz');
```

> Strip UTF-8 [byte order mark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark#UTF-8) (BOM) from a string

From Wikipedia:

> The Unicode Standard permits the BOM in UTF-8, but does not require nor recommend its use. Byte order has no meaning in UTF-8.


## Install

```
$ npm install --save strip-bom
```


## Usage

```js
const stripBom = require('strip-bom');

stripBom('\uFEFFunicorn');
//=> 'unicorn'
```

# strip-json-comments [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sindresorhus/strip-json-comments.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/sindresorhus/strip-json-comments)

> Strip comments from JSON. Lets you use comments in your JSON files!

This is now possible:

```js
{
	// Rainbows
	"unicorn": /* ❤ */ "cake"
}
```

It will replace single-line comments `//` and multi-line comments `/**/` with whitespace. This allows JSON error positions to remain as close as possible to the original source.

Also available as a [Gulp](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-strip-json-comments)/[Grunt](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-strip-json-comments)/[Broccoli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/broccoli-strip-json-comments) plugin.

## Install

```
$ npm install strip-json-comments
```

## Usage

```js
const json = `{
	// Rainbows
	"unicorn": /* ❤ */ "cake"
}`;

JSON.parse(stripJsonComments(json));
//=> {unicorn: 'cake'}
```

## API

### stripJsonComments(jsonString, options?)

#### jsonString

Type: `string`

Accepts a string with JSON and returns a string without comments.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### whitespace

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `true`

Replace comments with whitespace instead of stripping them entirely.

## Benchmark

```
$ npm run bench
```

## Getting started

Firstly, install the package:

```bash
npm install --save styled-jsx
```

Next, add `styled-jsx/babel` to `plugins` in your babel configuration:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["styled-jsx/babel"]
}
```

Now add `<style jsx>` to your code and fill it with CSS:

```jsx
export default () => (
  <div>
    <p>only this paragraph will get the style :)</p>

    {/* you can include <Component />s here that include
         other <p>s that don't get unexpected styles! */}

    <style jsx>{`
      p {
        color: red;
      }
    `}</style>
  </div>
)
```

## Configuration options

The following are optional settings for the babel plugin.

#### `optimizeForSpeed`

Blazing fast and optimized CSS rules injection system based on the CSSOM APIs.

```json
{
  "plugins": [["styled-jsx/babel", { "optimizeForSpeed": true }]]
}
```

When in production\* this mode is automatically enabled.<br>
Beware that when using this option source maps cannot be generated and styles cannot be edited via the devtools.

\* `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'`

#### `sourceMaps`

Generates source maps (default: `false`)

#### `styleModule`

Module that the transpiled files should import (default: `styled-jsx/style`)

#### `vendorPrefixes`

Turn on/off automatic vendor prefixing (default: `true`)

## Features

- Full CSS support, no tradeoffs in power
- Runtime size of just **3kb** (gzipped, from 12kb)
- Complete isolation: Selectors, animations, keyframes
- Built-in CSS vendor prefixing
- Very fast, minimal and efficient transpilation (see below)
- High-performance runtime-CSS-injection when not server-rendering
- Future-proof: Equivalent to server-renderable "Shadow CSS"
- Source maps support
- Dynamic styles and themes support
- CSS Preprocessing via Plugins

## Using in Next.js

Next.js automatically configures `styled-jsx` with babel or swc, you don't have to configure it manually.

## How It Works

The example above transpiles to the following:

```jsx
import _JSXStyle from 'styled-jsx/style'

export default () => (
  <div className="jsx-123">
    <p className="jsx-123">only this paragraph will get the style :)</p>
    <_JSXStyle id="123">{`p.jsx-123 {color: red;}`}</_JSXStyle>
  </div>
)
```

### Why It Works Like This

Unique classnames give us style encapsulation and `_JSXStyle` is heavily optimized for:

- Injecting styles upon render
- Only injecting a certain component's style once (even if the component is included multiple times)
- Removing unused styles
- Keeping track of styles for server-side rendering

### Targeting The Root

Notice that the outer `<div>` from the example above also gets a `jsx-123` classname. We do this so that
you can target the "root" element, in the same manner that
[`:host`](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom-201/#toc-style-host) works with Shadow DOM.

If you want to target _only_ the host, we suggest you use a class:

```jsx
export default () => (
  <div className="root">
    <style jsx>{`
      .root {
        color: green;
      }
    `}</style>
  </div>
)
```

### Global styles

To skip scoping entirely, you can make the global-ness of your styles
explicit by adding _global_.

```jsx
export default () => (
  <div>
    <style jsx global>{`
      body {
        background: red;
      }
    `}</style>
  </div>
)
```

The advantage of using this over `<style>` is twofold: no need
to use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to avoid escaping issues with CSS
and take advantage of `styled-jsx`'s de-duping system to avoid
the global styles being inserted multiple times.

### One-off global selectors

Sometimes it's useful to skip selectors scoping. In order to get a one-off global selector we support `:global()`, inspired by [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).

This is very useful in order to, for example, generate a _global class_ that
you can pass to 3rd-party components. For example, to style
`react-select` which supports passing a custom class via `optionClassName`:

```jsx
import Select from 'react-select'
export default () => (
  <div>
    <Select optionClassName="react-select" />

    <style jsx>{`
      /* "div" will be prefixed, but ".react-select" won't */

      div :global(.react-select) {
        color: red;
      }
    `}</style>
  </div>
)
```

### Dynamic styles

To make a component's visual representation customizable from the outside world there are three options.

#### Via interpolated dynamic props

Any value that comes from the component's `render` method scope is treated as dynamic. This makes it possible to use `props` and `state` for example.

```jsx
const Button = props => (
  <button>
    {props.children}
    <style jsx>{`
      button {
        padding: ${'large' in props ? '50' : '20'}px;
        background: ${props.theme.background};
        color: #999;
        display: inline-block;
        font-size: 1em;
      }
    `}</style>
  </button>
)
```

New styles' injection is optimized to perform well at runtime.

That said when your CSS is mostly static we recommend to split it up in static and dynamic styles and use two separate `style` tags so that, when changing, only the dynamic parts are recomputed/rendered.

```jsx
const Button = props => (
  <button>
    {props.children}
    <style jsx>{`
      button {
        color: #999;
        display: inline-block;
        font-size: 2em;
      }
    `}</style>
    <style jsx>{`
      button {
        padding: ${'large' in props ? '50' : '20'}px;
        background: ${props.theme.background};
      }
    `}</style>
  </button>
)
```

#### Via `className` toggling

The second option is to pass properties that toggle class names.

```jsx
const Button = props => (
  <button className={'large' in props && 'large'}>
    {props.children}
    <style jsx>{`
      button {
        padding: 20px;
        background: #eee;
        color: #999;
      }
      .large {
        padding: 50px;
      }
    `}</style>
  </button>
)
```

Then you would use this component as either `<Button>Hi</Button>` or `<Button large>Big</Button>`.

#### Via inline `style`

\***best for animations**

Imagine that you wanted to make the padding in the button above completely customizable. You can override the CSS you configure via inline-styles:

```jsx
const Button = ({ padding, children }) => (
  <button style={{ padding }}>
    {children}
    <style jsx>{`
      button {
        padding: 20px;
        background: #eee;
        color: #999;
      }
    `}</style>
  </button>
)
```

In this example, the padding defaults to the one set in `<style>` (`20`), but the user can pass a custom one via `<Button padding={30}>`.

### Constants

It is possible to use constants like so:

```jsx
import { colors, spacing } from '../theme'
import { invertColor } from '../theme/utils'

const Button = ({ children }) => (
  <button>
    {children}
    <style jsx>{`
      button {
        padding: ${spacing.medium};
        background: ${colors.primary};
        color: ${invertColor(colors.primary)};
      }
    `}</style>
  </button>
)
```

Please keep in mind that constants defined outside of the component scope are treated as static styles.

## Server-Side Rendering

`styled-jsx` v5 introduced `StyledRegistry` component and `useStyleRegistry` hook to let you scope styles rendering in each SSR render to keep concurrent-safe.

- `registry.styles()` will return the array of react components for style tags.
- `registry.flush()` can clean the existing styles in the registry, it's optional for SSR when you have a standalone registry for each SSR render.

> Next.js 12 integrates with `styled-jsx` v5 and manages the registry for you.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/server'
import { StyleRegistry, useStyleRegistry } from 'styled-jsx'
import App from './app'

function Styles() {
  const registry = useStyleRegistry()
  const styles = registry.styles()
  return <>{styles}</>
}

export default (req, res) => {
  const app = ReactDOM.renderToString(<App />)
  const html = ReactDOM.renderToStaticMarkup(
    <StyleRegistry>
      <html>
        <head>
          <Styles />
        </head>
        <body>
          <div id="root" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: app }} />
        </body>
      </html>
    </StyleRegistry>
  )
  res.end('<!doctype html>' + html)
}
```

There's also a new API `createStyleRegistry` that is introduced when you have to create a registry manually. In this way you can operate the registry yourself to extract the rendered styles (`registry.styles()`) or flush them out (`registry.flush()`).

```js
const registry = createStyleRegistry()
const styles = registry.styles() // access styles

function Page() {
  return (
    <StyleRegistry registry={registry}>
      <App />
    </StyleRegistry>
  )
}
```

By default `<StyleRegistry />` will use the `registry` from root top `StyleRegistry`, which means there's only one `registry` in the react tree.

It's **paramount** that you use one of these two functions so that
the generated styles can be diffed when the client loads and
duplicate styles are avoided.

### Content Security Policy

Strict [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is supported.

You should generate a nonce **per request**.

```js
import nanoid from 'nanoid'

const nonce = Buffer.from(nanoid()).toString('base64') //ex: N2M0MDhkN2EtMmRkYi00MTExLWFhM2YtNDhkNTc4NGJhMjA3
```

You must then pass a nonce to `registry.styles({ nonce })` **and** set a `<meta property="csp-nonce" content={nonce} />` tag.

Your CSP policy must share the same nonce as well (the header nonce needs to match the html nonce and remain unpredictable).
`Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'nonce-N2M0MDhkN2EtMmRkYi00MTExLWFhM2YtNDhkNTc4NGJhMjA3';`

### External CSS and styles outside of the component

In styled-jsx styles can be defined outside of the component's render method or in separate JavaScript modules using the `styled-jsx/css` library. `styled-jsx/css` exports three tags that can be used to tag your styles:

- `css`, the default export, to define scoped styles.
- `css.global` to define global styles.
- `css.resolve` to define scoped styles that resolve to the scoped `className` and a `styles` element.

#### External styles

In an external file:

```js
/* styles.js */
import css from 'styled-jsx/css'

// Scoped styles
export const button = css`
  button {
    color: hotpink;
  }
`

// Global styles
export const body = css.global`body { margin: 0; }`

// Resolved styles
export const link = css.resolve`a { color: green; }`
// link.className -> scoped className to apply to `a` elements e.g. jsx-123
// link.styles -> styles element to render inside of your component

// Works also with default exports
export default css`
  div {
    color: green;
  }
`
```

You can then import and use those styles:

```jsx
import styles, { button, body } from './styles'

export default () => (
  <div>
    <button>styled-jsx</button>
    <style jsx>{styles}</style>
    <style jsx>{button}</style>
    <style jsx global>
      {body}
    </style>
  </div>
)
```

N.B. All the tags except for [`resolve`](#the-resolve-tag) don't support dynamic styles.

`resolve` and `global` can also be imported individually:

```js
import { resolve } from 'styled-jsx/css'
import { global } from 'styled-jsx/css'
```

If you use Prettier we recommend you to use the default `css` export syntax since the tool doesn't support named imports.

#### Styles outside of components

The `css` tag from `styled-jsx/css` can be also used to define styles in your components files but outside of the component itself. This might help with keeping `render` methods smaller.

```jsx
import css from 'styled-jsx/css'

export default () => (
  <div>
    <button>styled-jsx</button>
    <style jsx>{button}</style>
  </div>
)

const button = css`
  button {
    color: hotpink;
  }
`
```

Like in externals styles `css` doesn't work with dynamic styles. If you have dynamic parts you might want to place them inline inside of your component using a regular `<style jsx>` element.

#### The `resolve` tag

The `resolve` tag from `styled-jsx/css` can be used when you need to scope some CSS - for example, if you need to style nested components from the parent, such as the `Link` component in the example below.

It works by returning the generated scoped `className` and related `styles`.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Link from 'some-library'

import css from 'styled-jsx/css'

const { className, styles } = css.resolve`
  a { color: green }
`

export default () => (
  <div>
    {/* use the className */}
    <Link className={className}>About</Link>

    {/* render the styles for it */}
    {styles}
  </div>
)
```

The `resolve` tag also supports dynamic styles, via template string interpolation:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import css from 'styled-jsx/css'

function getLinkStyles(color) {
  return css.resolve`
    a { color: ${color} }
  `
}

export default props => {
  const { className, styles } = getLinkStyles(props.theme.color)

  return (
    <div>
      <Link className={className}>About</Link>
      {styles}
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### Using `resolve` as a Babel macro

If you can't (or would rather not) make changes to your `.babelrc`, the `resolve` tag can be used as a Babel macro, thanks to the [`babel-plugin-macros`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros) system.

To set this up, first of all, install `styled-jsx` and `babel-plugin-macros`:

```bash
npm i --save styled-jsx
npm i --save-dev babel-plugin-macros
```

Next, add `babel-plugin-macros` to your Babel configuration:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["babel-plugin-macros"]
}
```

You can then use `resolve` by importing it from `styled-jsx/macro`.

```jsx
import css from 'styled-jsx/macro'

const { className, styles } = css.resolve`
  a { color: green }
`

export default () => (
  <div>
    <Link className={className}>About</Link>
    {styles}
  </div>
)
```

##### Usage with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev)

[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) comes with `babel-plugin-macros` already installed, so the only thing that needs to be done is to install `styled-jsx`:

```bash
npm i --save styled-jsx
```

Then `resolve` can be imported from `styled-jsx/macro` and used the same way as in the example in the [Using `resolve` as a Babel macro](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx/blob/main/readme.md#using-resolve-as-a-babel-macro) section above.

#### Styles in regular CSS files

styled-jsx v3 comes with a webpack loader that lets you write styles in regular `css` files and consume them in React.

```js
import styles from '../components/button/styles.css'

export default () => (
  <div>
    <button>styled-jsx</button>
    <style jsx>{styles}</style>
  </div>
)
```

To consume the styles in your component you can import them from your CSS file and render them using a `<style jsx>` tag. Remember to add the `global` prop if you want your styles to be global.

To use this feature you need to register the loader in your webpack config file, before `babel-loader` which will then transpile the styles via `styled-jsx/babel`

```js
config: {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: require('styled-jsx/webpack').loader,
            options: {
              type: 'scoped'
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The plugin accepts a `type` option to configure whether the styles should be `scoped`, `global` or `resolve` (see above). By default its values is set to `scoped`. `type` can also be a `function` which takes the `fileName` and the `fileNameQuery` that is being transpiled and must return a valid type.

```js
type validTypes = 'scoped' | 'global' | 'resolve'
type fileName = string
type Options = {|
  type: validTypes | ((fileName, options) => validTypes)
|}
```

```js
import styles from './styles.css?type=global'

// webpack
config: {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: require('styled-jsx/webpack').loader,
            options: {
              type: (fileName, options) => options.query.type || 'scoped'
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The type can also be set per individual CSS file via CSS comment:

```css
/* @styled-jsx=scoped */

button {
  color: red;
}
```

The CSS comment option will override the one in the webpack configuration only for this specific file.

##### Next.js

Example of `next.config.js` to integrate `styled-jsx/webpack`:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { defaultLoaders }) => {
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.css$/,
      use: [
        defaultLoaders.babel,
        {
          loader: require('styled-jsx/webpack').loader,
          options: {
            type: 'scoped'
          }
        }
      ]
    })

    return config
  }
}
```

## CSS Preprocessing via Plugins

Styles can be preprocessed via plugins.

Plugins are regular JavaScript modules that export a simple function with the following signature:

```ts
function plugin(css: string, options: Object): string
```

Basically they accept a CSS string in input, optionally modify it and finally return it.

Plugins make it possible to use popular preprocessors like SASS, Less, Stylus, PostCSS or apply custom transformations to the styles at **compile time**.

To register a plugin add an option `plugins` for `styled-jsx/babel` to your `.babelrc`. `plugins` must be an array of module names or _full_ paths for local plugins.

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "styled-jsx/babel",
      {
        "plugins": [
          "my-styled-jsx-plugin-package",
          "/full/path/to/local/plugin"
        ]
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Instructions to integrate with Next.js</summary>
  In order to register styled-jsx plugins in a Next.js app you need to create a custom .babelrc file:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "next/babel",
      {
        "styled-jsx": {
          "plugins": ["styled-jsx-plugin-postcss"]
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

This is a fairly new feature so make sure that you using a version of Next.js that supports passing options to `styled-jsx`.

</details>
<br>

Plugins are applied in definition order left to right before styles are scoped.

In order to resolve local plugins paths you can use NodeJS' [require.resolve](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_require_resolve).

N.B. when applying the plugins styled-jsx replaces template literals expressions with placeholders because otherwise CSS parsers would get invalid CSS E.g.

```css
/* `ExprNumber` is a number */
%%styled-jsx-placeholder-ExprNumber%%
```

**Plugins won't transform expressions** (eg. dynamic styles).

When publishing a plugin you may want to add the keywords: `styled-jsx` and `styled-jsx-plugin`.
We also encourage you to use the following naming convention for your plugins:

```
styled-jsx-plugin-<your-plugin-name>
```

#### Plugin options

Users can set plugin options by registering a plugin as an array that contains
the plugin path and an options object.

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "styled-jsx/babel",
      {
        "plugins": [
          ["my-styled-jsx-plugin-package", { "exampleOption": true }]
        ],
        "sourceMaps": true
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

Each plugin receives a `options` object as second argument which contains
the babel and user options:

```js
;(css, options) => {
  /* ... */
}
```

The `options` object has the following shape:

```js
{
  // user options go here
  // eg. exampleOption: true

  // babel options
  babel: {
    sourceMaps: boolean,
    vendorPrefixes: boolean,
    isGlobal: boolean,
    filename: ?string, // defined only when the filename option is passed to Babel, such as when using Babel CLI or Webpack
    location: { // the original location of the CSS block in the JavaScript file
      start: {
        line: number,
        column: number,
      },
      end: {
        line: number,
        column: number,
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example plugins

The following plugins are proof of concepts/sample:

- [styled-jsx-plugin-sass](https://github.com/giuseppeg/styled-jsx-plugin-sass)
- [styled-jsx-plugin-postcss](https://github.com/giuseppeg/styled-jsx-plugin-postcss)
- [styled-jsx-plugin-stylelint](https://github.com/giuseppeg/styled-jsx-plugin-stylelint)
- [styled-jsx-plugin-less](https://github.com/erasmo-marin/styled-jsx-plugin-less)
- [styled-jsx-plugin-stylus](https://github.com/omardelarosa/styled-jsx-plugin-stylus)

## Rendering in tests

If you're using a tool such as Enzyme, you might want to avoid compiling your styles in test renders. In general, styled-jsx artifacts like `jsx-123` classnames and vendor prefixing are not direct concerns of your component, and they generate a lot of snapshot noise.

One option is to exclude the `styled-jsx/babel` plugin from the `test` environment using `env` in your Babel config (see [Config Merging options](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/options#config-merging-options)).

But this can cause noise in your terminal output when rendering:

```
   console.error node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:527
      Warning: Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `jsx`.
```

The `styled-jsx/babel-test` solves this problem. It simply strips `jsx` attributes from all `<style>` tags. Be sure to target each environment with the appropriate plugin:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "plugins": ["styled-jsx/babel"]
    },
    "development": {
      "plugins": ["styled-jsx/babel"]
    },
    "test": {
      "plugins": ["styled-jsx/babel-test"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### styled-jsx/css in tests

When using `styled-jsx/babel-test`, `styled-jsx/css` throws the following error:

```
styled-jsx/css: if you are getting this error it means that your `css` tagged template literals were not transpiled.
```

to solve this issue you need to mock `styled-jsx/css`. You can find a guide at the following link https://kevinjalbert.com/jest-snapshots-reducing-styled-jsx-noise/

## FAQ

### Warning: unknown `jsx` prop on &lt;style&gt; tag

If you get this warning it means that your styles were not compiled by styled-jsx.

Please take a look at your setup and make sure that everything is correct and that the styled-jsx transformation is ran by Babel.

### Can I return an array of components when using React 16?

No, this feature is not supported. However we support React Fragments, which are available in React `16.2.0` and above.

```jsx
const StyledImage = ({ src, alt = '' }) => (
  <React.Fragment>
    <img src={src} alt={alt} />
    <style jsx>{`
      img {
        max-width: 100%;
      }
    `}</style>
  </React.Fragment>
)
```

### Styling third parties / child components from the parent

When the component accepts a `className` (or ad-hoc) prop as a way to allow customizations then you can use [the `resolve` tag from `styled-jsx/css`](#the-resolve-tag).

When the component doesn't accept any `className` or doesn't expose any API to customize the component, then your only option is to use `:global()` styles:

```jsx
export default () => (
  <div>
    <ExternalComponent />

    <style jsx>{`
      /* "div" will be prefixed, but ".nested-element" won't */

      div > :global(.nested-element) {
        color: red;
      }
    `}</style>
  </div>
)
```

Please keep in mind that `:global()` styles will affect the entire subtree, so in many cases you may want to be careful and use the children (direct descendant) selector `>`.

### Build a component library with styled-jsx

There's an [article](https://medium.com/@tomaszmularczyk89/guide-to-building-a-react-components-library-with-rollup-and-styled-jsx-694ec66bd2) explaining how to bundle React components with Rollup and styled-jsx as an external dependency.

## Syntax Highlighting

When working with template literals a common drawback is missing syntax highlighting. The following editors currently have support for highlighting CSS inside `<style jsx>` elements.

_If you have a solution for an editor not on the list_ **please [open a PR](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx/pull/new/main)** _and let us now._

### Atom

The [`language-babel`](https://github.com/gandm/language-babel) package for the [Atom editor](https://atom.io/) has an option to [extend the grammar for JavaScript tagged template literals](https://github.com/gandm/language-babel#javascript-tagged-template-literal-grammar-extensions).

After [installing the package](https://github.com/gandm/language-babel#installation) add the code below to the appropriate settings entry. In a few moments you should be blessed with proper CSS syntax highlighting. ([source](https://github.com/gandm/language-babel/issues/324))

```
"(?<=<style jsx>{)|(?<=<style jsx global>{)|(?<=css)":source.css.styled
```

![babel-language settings entry](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2313237/22627258/6c97cb68-ebb7-11e6-82e1-60205f8b31e7.png)

### Webstorm/Idea

The IDE let you inject any language in place with _Inject language or reference_ in an _Intention Actions_ (default _alt+enter_).
Simply perform the action in the string template and select CSS.
You get full CSS highlighting and autocompletion and it will last until you close the IDE.

Additionally you can use language injection comments to enable all the IDE language features indefinitely using the language comment style:

```jsx
import { colors, spacing } from '../theme'
import { invertColor } from '../theme/utils'

const Button = ({ children }) => (
  <button>
    {children}

    {/*language=CSS*/}
    <style jsx>{`
      button {
        padding: ${spacing.medium};
        background: ${colors.primary};
        color: ${invertColor(colors.primary)};
      }
    `}</style>
  </button>
)
```

### Emmet

If you're using Emmet you can add the following snippet to `~/emmet/snippets-styledjsx.json` This will allow you to expand `style-jsx` to a styled-jsx block.

```json
{
  "html": {
    "snippets": {
      "style-jsx": "<style jsx>{`\n\t$1\n`}</style>"
    }
  }
}
```

```

### Vim

Install [vim-styled-jsx](https://github.com/alampros/vim-styled-jsx) with your plugin manager of choice.

## ESLint

If you're using `eslint-plugin-import`, the `css` import will generate errors, being that it's a "magic" import (not listed in package.json). To avoid these, simply add the following line to your eslint configuration:

```
"settings": {"import/core-modules": ["styled-jsx/css"] }
```

## TypeScript

If you're using TypeScript, then in order to allow `<style jsx>` tags to be properly understood by it, create a file named "styled-jsx.d.ts" anywhere within your project containing the following, or add this line to the top of any single existing .ts file within your project:

```ts
/// <reference types="styled-jsx" />
```

> If you're using babel to transform styled-jsx code with TypeScript, you need to specify `"jsx": "preserve"` in your tsconfig.json to keep the original JSX and let babel parse and transform with styled-jsx babel plugin.

	console.log('Terminal stdout supports 256 colors');
}

if (supportsColor.stderr.has16m) {
	console.log('Terminal stderr supports 16 million colors (truecolor)');
}
```


## API

Returns an `Object` with a `stdout` and `stderr` property for testing either streams. Each property is an `Object`, or `false` if color is not supported.

The `stdout`/`stderr` objects specifies a level of support for color through a `.level` property and a corresponding flag:

- `.level = 1` and `.hasBasic = true`: Basic color support (16 colors)
- `.level = 2` and `.has256 = true`: 256 color support
- `.level = 3` and `.has16m = true`: Truecolor support (16 million colors)


## Info

It obeys the `--color` and `--no-color` CLI flags.

For situations where using `--color` is not possible, use the environment variable `FORCE_COLOR=1` (level 1), `FORCE_COLOR=2` (level 2), or `FORCE_COLOR=3` (level 3) to forcefully enable color, or `FORCE_COLOR=0` to forcefully disable. The use of `FORCE_COLOR` overrides all other color support checks.

Explicit 256/Truecolor mode can be enabled using the `--color=256` and `--color=16m` flags, respectively.

## 2015-05-22, version 4.0.0

### General

- Changed the build scripts to include a transpilation of ES6 to ES5
  (using http://babel.org), so we can use ES6 features in the vis.js code.
  When creating a custom bundle using browserify, one now needs to add a
  transform step using `babelify`, this is described in README.md.

### Timeline

  padding). In order to have overflowing text, one should now apply css style
  `.vis.timeline .item.range { overflow: visible; }` instead of
  `.vis.timeline .item.range .content { overflow: visible; }`.
  See example 18_range_overflow.html.
- Fixed invalid css names for time axis grid, renamed hours class names from
  `4-8h` to `h4-h8`.
- Deprecated option `showCustomTime`. Use method `addCustomTime()` instead.
- Deprecated event `finishedRedraw` as it's redundant.
- Renamed option `animate` to `animation`, and changed it to be either a boolean
  or an object `{duration: number, easingFunction: string}`.

```markdown
# Contributing

The WordJS Libraries should be free and clear to use in your projects.  In
order to maintain that, every contributor must be vigilant.

There have been many projects in the past that have been very lax regarding
licensing, and we are of the opinion that those are ticking timebombs and that
no corporate product should depend on them.  


# Required Reading

These are pretty short reads and emphasize the importance of proper licensing:

- https://github.com/kennethreitz/tablib/issues/114 (discussion of other tools)

- http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/04/pick-a-license-any-license.html


# Raising Issues

Issues should generally be accompanied by test files.  Since github does not
support attachments, the best method is to send files to <sheetjs@gmail.com>
(subject line should contain issue number or message) or to share using some
storage service.  Unless expressly permitted, any attachments will not be
shared or included in a test suite (although I will ask :)

# Pre-Contribution Checklist

Before thinking about contributing, make sure that:

- You are not, nor have ever been, an employee of Microsoft Corporation.

- You have not signed any NDAs or Shared Source Agreements with Microsoft 
  Corporation or a subsidiary

- You have not consulted any existing relevant codebase (if you have, please
take note of which codebases were consulted).

If you cannot attest to each of these items, the best approach is to raise an
issue.  If it is a particularly high-priority issue, please drop an email to
<sheetjs@gmail.com> and it will be prioritized.


# Intra-Contribution

Keep these in mind as you work:

- Your contributions are your original work.  Take note of any resources you
  consult in the process (and be extra careful not to use unlicensed code on
  the internet.

- You are working on your own time.  Unless they explicitly grant permission, 
  your employer may be the ultimate owner of your IP


# Post-Contribution 

Before contributions are merged, you will receive an email (at the address
associated with the git commit) and will be asked to confirm the aforementioned
items.

```

## 0.9.3 (2017-03-15)

* XLML property names are more closely mapped to the XLSX equivalent
* Stub cells are now cell type `z`

## 0.9.2 (2017-03-13)

* Removed stale TypeScript definition files.  Flowtype comments are used in the
  `xlsx.flow.js` source and stripped to produce `xlsx.js`.
* sed usage reworked to support GNU sed in-place form.  BSD sed seems to work,
  but the build script has not been tested on other sed variants:

```bash
$ sed -i.ext  [...] # GNU
$ sed -i .ext [...] # bsd
```

## 0.9.0 (2017-03-09)

* Removed ods.js source.  The xlsx.js source absorbed the ODS logic and exposes
  the ODS variable, so projects should remove references to ods.js

```markdown
# yocto-queue [![](https://badgen.net/bundlephobia/minzip/yocto-queue)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=yocto-queue)

> Tiny queue data structure

You should use this package instead of an array if you do a lot of `Array#push()` and `Array#shift()` on large arrays, since `Array#shift()` has [linear time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(N)%E2%80%94Linear%20Time) *O(n)* while `Queue#dequeue()` has [constant time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(1)%20%E2%80%94%20Constant%20Time) *O(1)*. That makes a huge difference for large arrays.

> A [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is an ordered list of elements where an element is inserted at the end of the queue and is removed from the front of the queue. A queue works based on the first-in, first-out ([FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics))) principle.

## Install

```
$ npm install yocto-queue
```

## Usage

```js
const Queue = require('yocto-queue');

const queue = new Queue();

queue.enqueue('🦄');
queue.enqueue('🌈');

console.log(queue.size);
//=> 2

console.log(...queue);
//=> '🦄 🌈'

console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> '🦄'

console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> '🌈'
```

## API

### `queue = new Queue()`

The instance is an [`Iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols), which means you can iterate over the queue front to back with a “for…of” loop, or use spreading to convert the queue to an array. Don't do this unless you really need to though, since it's slow.

#### `.enqueue(value)`

Add a value to the queue.

#### `.dequeue()`

Remove the next value in the queue.

Returns the removed value or `undefined` if the queue is empty.

#### `.clear()`

Clear the queue.

#### `.size`

The size of the queue.

### Fichier : `./prompt.md`
```markdown

Hi Claude!You are an expert in web development even one of the best specialized in nestjs with tailwind css and typescript and an amazinf UI/UX that has made one of the best ranked designed web pages in the world.  I'm working on a **Next.js project** with type script and tailwind css already configured, and I want your help to **seriously level up the design and polish** of my entire app. Here’s the full scope of what I need help with, progressively:

---

### 🚀 Project Context

I have already:

* Set up **internationalization (i18n)** using `next-intl` and defined the theme of colors in globals.css that have to be uded althrough the appplication
* Implemented **theme switching** (light/dark mode)
* Created **routing and pages**
* Built a **Navbar** and basic structure for components

Now, I want you to help me:

---
### 🎨 **0. Fix the theme switcher component**
Its not actually working, before i added tailwind css it was working but since then when i click ont it nothing changes, it simply adopts the system's thme, i want you to fix it so that i can easily move from light theme to dark theme

### 🎨 **1. Revamp the Entire UI/UX**

I want a **professional-grade** look and feel, like on the best modern web apps.

* ⚡ **The entire web application must have a unique, modern design not look like a generated application**

  * Use **engaging layouts**, **modern fonts**, **shadow depth**, **interactive hover effects**, etc.
  * Make use of the colors i want on my site and they should be generally configured in the globals.css if there ar updates to be done there do so/ I want these two colors to be really present on my website:  #1e0546 and #8e43ff for the light and as well as the dark themes: on buttons, titles, components...
  * Introduce nice and smooth animations and transitions, components should have interestin dynamic components for user to continue having the envy to keep on scrolling on each page and especially on the home page

* 🎨 **Responsive Design**

  * Mobile, tablet and desktop optimized.
  * Adaptable grids, well-aligned spacing, and components that reflow smartly.

* 🌈 **Color Scheme**

  * Not monotonous or boring with the two colors mentionnend above actively present and configured in the globals.css.
  * Should work across both **light and dark** modes.

* ✨ **Animations and Transitions**

  * Smooth transitions between pages (e.g. `framer-motion`, CSS transitions).
  * Animated elements like buttons, cards, modals, etc.

* 🧩 **Well-Designed Components**

  * Buttons, inputs, cards, modals, forms, tabs, etc.
  * Follow modern design trends (Neumorphism, Glassmorphism, Material, or Minimal — suggest what's best).

---

### 🔄 **2. Fix Functional Problems**

#### a. Theme Switcher not working

* Only dark mode is showing (likely due to system default).
* Clicking the ThemeSwitcher on the Navbar doesn’t change themes.
* I want a **manual toggle** that overrides system mode.

#### b. i18n Issues

* Some pages (`Help`, `About`, `Dashboard`) don’t display translation messages properly.
* Ensure all pages render i18n messages correctly.

---

### 🧭 **3. Navbar Improvements**

Design and functionality:

* Left side:Name of application (SYNAPSE)
* Center side:

  * `Home`, `Workbench`, `About`, `Help` links
* Right side:

  * `ThemeSwitcher` (manual toggle)
  * `LanguageSwitcher` (between `en`, `fr`, `es`)
  * If user is **authenticated**: Show `Dashboard` link with icon + user name
  * Else: Show `Login` link with icon

Design expectations:

* Responsive mobile dropdown menu
* Sticky top navigation with scroll animation (shrink on scroll, etc.)

---

### 🗂️ Pages Already Created (to redesign beautifully)

* Home
* About
* Help
* Workbench
* Dashboard
* Login

---

### 📦 Tech Stack

* **Next.js**
* `next-intl` for i18n
* `tailwindcss` for styling
* `next-themes` for theme switching
* Basic authentication logic present

---

### 🧠 Execution Instructions

Please help me progressively:

1. Start by analyzing the repo and setting up the design system.
2. Refactor the Navbar with full functionality and styles .
3. Fix the theme and i18n problems.
4. Tackle each page one-by-one, enhancing visuals and structure.
5. Ensure everything is **clean, readable, and modular.**

---

### 🧵 GitHub Repository

I have added my git repository to the project

---

Let me know if you need environment variables or authentication details to test logged-in logic. Also feel free to suggest packages that improve UX (e.g. Framer Motion, ShadCN UI, React Icons).

Thanks! I want this to feel like a top-tier, production-ready app — polish matters.

Now, I want you to help me:

### 🎨 **1. all components you design should be for good Entire UI/UX: focus only on the Workbench components**

I want a **professional-grade** look and feel, like on the best modern web apps.

* ⚡ **The entire web application must have a unique, modern design not look like a generated application**

  * Use **engaging layouts**, **modern fonts**, **shadow depth**, **interactive hover effects**, etc.

### 🔄 **2. Build a functional workbench**
I want the workbench to be be well designed and do all the task to be done, with responsive.we will use libairies such as vis.js, D3.js for the grapphs.  It is the core of our application. So it should be really well done:
 * We should import excel files with extension .xlsx, or extract those files from a zip or from a folder. and verify that this excel file has the following sheets within it: "Abonné", "Listing", "Fréquence par cellule", "Fréquence Correspondant", "Fréquence par Durée appel", "Fréquence par IMEI", "Identification des abonnés"
 * After the import a message will be displayed about the import if it failed, or if it was successful, so you will create a component for that that will display that message at the top right of screen and will be used althrouh the app, the color used should be indicative of the type of message: warning, info, success, failure ...
 * Next we will display two main graphs by exploiting the infos obtained from the different sheets, the aim of this app is to be able to visualize the interactions of an individual with people based on his listing so the interactions are seen in the sheet "Listing", an individual is identified by his number: so on the graph the nodes will be the individuals and the edges will be the interactions they had: SMS or call
 * Besides that we should be able to get informations about an individual by clicking on a node that will display those infos about the individual in a little node just like in Google Maps for places
 * The level of interaction of individuals should be seen from the color of their edges in progressive range: from green, yellow, orange, to red increeasingly also the size of the node should be obtained from the lelvel of interactions the indidual has
 * We should also have components for filter(based on interaction through SMS, phone calls, period of interaction, Interactions with one or more individuals identified by their IMEI or phone number) and search
 * The second graph should display the different localization of people through the day on a localization graph from Google Maps or Open street maps such that the path of a infividual will be the different points where he received a call or an sms. Each individual should have a color, such that from the graph we can see it they met or not and so on.
Some components have been designed for the workbench already dont go from scratch proceed to ameliorate them and make them fully functional such as: FileUploader, NetworkGraph, FilterPanel

### 🧠 Execution Instructions

Please help me progressively:

1. Start by analyzing the repo and then we focus on the workbench.
2. Build the components that will makeup the workbech
3. Build a functional Workbench ans then test to ameliorate
4. Tackle each page one-by-one, to ameliorate design: Home
5. Ensure everything is **clean, readable, and modular.**
