  },
  "FAQ": {
    "q1": "What types of data can I import?",
    "a1": "SYNAPSE currently supports structured data in CSV and JSON formats. The data should represent entities (like people or organizations) and the interactions between them (like calls, messages, or transactions).",
    "q2": "Is my data secure?",
    "a2": "Absolutely. Security is our top priority. All data transmission is encrypted via HTTPS, and our backend enforces strict role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information.",
    "q3": "How does the pathfinding analysis work?",
    "a3": "The pathfinding feature uses powerful algorithms to find the shortest path between any two selected nodes in the graph. This is useful for discovering indirect connections that are not immediately obvious.",
    "q4": "Can I customize the theme?",
    "a4": "Yes. You can switch between light and dark themes from your user dashboard. The application can also be set to follow your system's theme preference automatically."
