Hello Chat. I am working on my internship project that is used by cybersecurity analysts to visualize interactions between individuals and come out with the most relevant patterns. So we use large amount of data extracted from excel files that contain different sheets and theese sheets contain listings obtained from telephonic operators such as orange mtn based on number or on IMEI of the phone; theinformations about the subscribers, the statistics : frequency per corrrespondant .... We have already done significant advancements and after yesterday's presentation, the supervisor asked us to work on certain points to mahe the application more usable in the image attached to my prompts. So i want you to give me a very good and well formulated prompt that i will give to Claude and he will assist me progreessively on how to achieve these tasks and from there we will proceed to do it. I will also give him the keycomponenets of the page such that we will ameliorate based on what was already done. The supervisor insisted on making patterns of interactions more visible given that it will be used for criminal investigations based on listings of telephonic operators.
